<p>Maybe I was just in a disagreeable mood, I don’t know.</p>
<p>Regarding music, I’d tend to reckon it’s the <em>songs</em> that are to be liked (maybe even the styles), not the musicians who play the music themselves.<br />Perhaps I can say that because I listen to music on my computer or iPod or whatever, rather than in-person, live performances.<br />Perhaps I say that since the important thing is what you like about the song, not about how the song has been brought about.<br />– As an example, popular society says that all music from Justin Bieber is awful. This is a dumb thing to say, since, if you happen to find yourself liking a song from Justin Bieber, you’re then in a shitty situation. You’d be better off saying all the music you’ve heard from Bieber is awful.<br />The same surely applies for categorical praise of an artist. (What if they covered a Justin Bieber song?).</p>
<p>Perhaps that’s why I was slightly disgruntled at a “I love [this particular band who happens to be popular at the moment, of which I’ve never mentioned/said a thing about before]” statement.<br />Everyone loves that band. It’s popular at the moment.<br />Those who don’t like it probably don’t like it because of its popularity. (So hipster).</p>
<p>But perhaps I could ask.. what’s important isn’t that you <em>like</em> it. Lots of people like that music.<br />What’s more valuable to know is <em>why</em>. Why do <em>you</em> like it?</p>
<p>I think here “because it’s good” is a crockshit answer.<br />I like music, but how the fuck could I be the judge of whether music is ‘good’ or not? (Let alone that that’s a statement about aesthetics..). I like lots of music which is good, lots which isn’t, and I’m sure there’s good music I don’t like.</p>
<p>But music is surely an intrinsically emotional thing.<br /><em>Why</em> do you like it?</p>
<p>I like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwti4feAA6k">this music</a> because because it’s in Band of Brothers. (Duh). I remember good times watching Band of Brothers with my parents as a teenager.<br />Which mightn’t be a unique reason to like the music, but that’s why <em>I</em> like it; this reason belongs to me since I’m sure others can’t say they like it because they watched it with my parents.</p>
<p>Less unique, but Kanye West’s Power still evokes that scene from Saints Row 3; and if you look up Bonnie Tyler’s “Holding out for a Hero”, I’d be confident one of the top comments is going to be something like “I’m coming, Shaundi!”.<br />Perhaps I can still say this reason belongs to me since I was the one who enjoyed playing through SR3. (Others did, too, I’m not saying they didn’t. But it’s a good memory for me..).</p>
<p>Or perhaps I love the music I first heard when I was in high-school ’cause it brings me back to that time (and the nostalgic, good memories of such..).<br />And so if I were to be honest and personal about why I like that music, it’s surely going to be a personal reason.</p>
<p>Calling bullshit on all the above, maybe, would be that I like the (fun part of) the Tchaikovsky’s 1812 Overture.<br />It’s loud and fun and cannons and shit.<br />Ah, well.</p>
