</div>

<p>The other day something wonderful happened in a chat group I’m in.<br />
Upon reading David Wong’s excellent <a href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-reasons-trumps-rise-that-no-one-talks-about/">discussion of rural voter
mindset</a>,
a friend made the remark like “we need more ‘empathic explainers’, rather than
‘explainer’ articles”.</p>
<p>I agree with the sentiment.. but my mind thinks in ways like “what are the
obstacles”.<br />
So I can agree that the stated “people aren’t sharing articles which
empathetically discuss the other”, and prob’ly “it’s difficult to find
resources to help emphathise with the other”.. essentially I’d say the people
apparently don’t want to sympathise with the other; and maybe the
infrastructure in place is such that they’re unlikely to.</p>
<hr />
<p>Taking an example. My understanding is Fox News was made as a ‘safe space’ for
right-wing ideology. But it’s not hard to believe the right has <a href="https://praxis.ink/2016/08/the-conservative-media-echo-chamber-has-made-the-right-deaf-to-reality/">“constructed
an intellectual ghetto that no one else wants to
visit”</a>.</p>
<p>The title of the previous link refers to an echo chamber; I’d say the problem
of echo chambers isn’t unique to one side. On the other hand, though, while
it’s convenient to discuss the problems as symmetric at the meta-level, I don’t
believe the climate is symmetric (unless maybe considered on a long-enough
timeline).</p>
<p>But, y’see… who exactly has a neutral view of things? Something it seems my
news feed doesn’t seem to understand is,<br />
if you ask a non-fanatic Clinton supporter “who’s going to win 2016 election?”,
they’re likely to say “oh, probably Trump” prob’ly followed by “so many voters
are idiots”;<br />
and similarly a non-fanatic Trump supporter, “oh, probably Clinton” prob’ly
followed by “the elites &amp; MSM have pretty much rigged the system”.<br />
– Or, rather, “who’s going to win? probably not my candidate”.<br />
And the next iteration of thought then ought to be .. “gee, people seem to
always think their side is losing; but, really, <em>those</em> people are the ones
with power”.<br />
– I don’t mean “people are biased”. My lament is that people are <em>unaware</em>
that their opponents often think in the same <em>form</em> as they do.</p>
<p>And if people don’t recognise <em>forms</em> of thought like this.. how can we expect
people to themselves become more empathetic to opinions they don’t know about?</p>
<hr />
<p>I like Miller’s Law. I think Wikipedia’s phrasing is like “Suspend judgement
until you’ve listened to find out what statement you’re hearing is true about”.<br />
My understanding is more like this. No one genuinely says something while
thinking “hey this is dumb of me to say”; but many genuinely expressed opinions
are gross or otherwise dumb.<br />
Like “how could this guy be so stupid” dumb. (ProTip, “because he’s
racist/sexist/gross” isn’t sufficient effort to count as “listening”).<br />
– Ergo, if a statement sounds really awfully dumb in such a way you couldn’t
pass Intellectual-Turing-Test for it, you’ve not understood the truth the
statement brings.</p>
<p>Sturgeon’s Law is probably another nice law here: “90 percent of everything is
crap”.</p>
<p>– With the above two in mind, what fucking point is there in the common anger
in how politics usually gets discussed: “look, someone from the other tribe
said something dumb!”. (Watch <em>any</em> John Oliver or Daily Show video to see this
form of statement). – It’s <em>so</em> satisfying to see how stupid those from the
other tribe are. (Well, beneath the anger, anyway).</p>
<p>The other tribe is disgusting <em>by definition</em>.<br />
The other tribe isn’t bad at the things you think the other tribe is bad at;
the other tribe is bad at things your tribe is good at.</p>
<p>And your tribe is bad at things the other tribe is good at.<br />
– In reaction to “people are biased; I’m a person and so I don’t know what
things I’m wrong about”, I suppose a rational response would be to have people
who can disagree with you on-hand so you can find out what you’re wrong about.
Who does that? I mean, I think it’s fine that people aren’t truth-seekers like
this. But still.</p>
<p>Short of that, for myself, I’d say it’s possible to reason about the things
you’re wrong about by their form.<br />
Tools and rules ought to work impartially.<br />
If someone from the other tribe would be a complete-fucking-idiot for saying
the same kindof thing, then prob’ly you should hold off.</p>
<p>(Other heuristics are like, e.g. “the world is a complicated place; unqualified
or unnuanced statements are probably wrong overall, though may contain some
truths”, or forms like “if the other side were consistent about X, then they
would say/do Y”, etc.).</p>
<hr />
<p>“The purpose of the internet is to say all sorts of random shit, and then
defend what you say as if it were God’s own truth” is something like a tweet I
saw once. I quite liked it.</p>
<p>I’d love to see an adaptation of a particular xkcd comic.<br />
Not the “someone on the internet was <em>wrong</em>” one. (The artist is still a smug
piece of shit there; holding that the artist’s opinion is probably the right
one).<br />
The one which goes “there are too many competing standards, we need a new
standard to bring them together” and suddenly there are N+1 competing
standards.<br />
– There are too many dumb opinions on the internet. Someone ought to give a
right opinion with nuance showing people the errors in their thinking. And
suddenly there are N+1 dumb opinions on the internet.</p>
<p>I vaguely recall an old Bertrand Russell quote(?) … <a href="http://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/03/04/self-doubt/">this
one</a>. “The fundamental
cause of the trouble in the modern world today is that the stupid are cocksure
while the intelligent are full of doubt”.<br />
(Russell apparently had some good quotes; e.g. <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/b/bertrandru403503.html">“Why is propaganda so much more
successful when it stirs up hatred than when it tries to stir up friendly
feeling?</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell">“Nine-tenths of the activities of a modern Government are harmful; therefore
the worse they are performed, the
better.”</a>).<br />
– I’d adapt this idea a bit: those sensible enough to know that expressing
political opinions is fucking annoying know to not share their opinion.</p>
<p>If you had a dumb opinion, how would you know?<br />
Surely you’d still feel your opinion superior, that “the people need to know!”?</p>
<hr />
<p>The way Facebook and Twitter structure their interaction also shapes how people
think.</p>
<p>Tumblr is prob’ly the worst, wherein you don’t get to see responses to posts;
so propaganda can proliferate uninterrupted.</p>
<p>Facebook is ‘notorious’ in this respect for its filter-bubble, wherein its
newsfeed only shows you parts of things.. – But on the whole,
filtered-information-shapes-thought has been around for ages; it’s why English
translations of the Bible were so controversial at first. (It’d bypass the
in-place power structure, right).<br />
– But, really, wouldn’t it be great if your tribe could have such influence
over mainstream media and education, etc. such that the views of the other
tribe were pretty much unheard of?</p>
<p>I’d say the limitation with Facebook is it’s “among friends”. And if your
friends aren’t INTJs, arguing doesn’t seem to be so welcomed.</p>
<p>I don’t think Twitter is necessarily limited by its 140-character posts. People
seem to chain them well enough, mostly. – I even prefer it for that; the cost
of a tweet is much lower, so it’s easier to share interesting tweets.<br />
But the inevitable problem is, you’re defining your own stream of information.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://popehat.com/2014/10/10/strange-seeds-on-distant-shores/">“fish don’t know that they’re in
water”</a>. (The
quote continues “We’re so surrounded by people who think like us, that it’s
impossible to see that what we think are universal truths are just our local
culture. / We can’t see it until we get outside of it.”).<br />
– The quote is well enough in theme with the above; the article is a nice
discussion of the culture-wars, going all the way back to English Civil War.</p>
<p><a href="http://status451.com/2016/01/06/splain-it-to-me/">Alice Maz’s utterly fantastic post
here</a> discusses, ostensibly,
how different people view interactions on Twitter differently; and goes on to
discuss ‘status-games and signalling’; how the social games people play forms
culture. (And how the same actions get seen as normal or as rude depending on
which cultural group you’re from).</p>
<p>Similarly good is anything from Jonathan Haidt discussing morality.<br />
His book “The Righteous Mind” discusses humanity’s righteousness as “a feature,
not a bug”.<br />
The most fascinating model from the book is the <a href="http://moralfoundations.org/">Moral Foundation
Theory</a>. (The link includes a paragraph discussing
MFT for modelling the culture wars of recent decades in the US).</p>
<hr />
<p>I use the terms “tribal” and “the other” a lot in the above; for a good overview
of tribalism, I’d recommend
<a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/">“I can tolerate anything except the
outgroup”</a>
(although it is rather long, yes).</p>
<p>While of course all models are wrong, some models are useful; and I’d think
tribalism well-covers the culture wars, and you’d be hard-pressed to find a
different model you can substitute in its place.</p>
<hr />
<p>If there’s any sense to the above, it’s a “takes one to know one” kinda thing.<br />
In that respect, I don’t suppose I’d hope for “people to get along better”, or
“people to be all super-rational”, etc. – But surely at some point after
enough anger and outrage, people have to be aware of the rules of the game?</p>
