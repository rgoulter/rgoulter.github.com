<p>It seems everyone always laments “Back in the day, when men were men..”, as everyone always has. (The trick is things never were?).<br />
And I’d hate to sound like I’m saying that.<br />
And as a young person myself, I can’t exactly say it’s awful to be young.<br />
So the title is rather more dramatic than my point.</p>
<p>I see, though, politics.<br />
And what has been a love-hate-fear fascination for me, arguments.<br />
I see that it’s much harder to engage in an argument online with someone you know in person than with some online internet construct.</p>
<p>– If you’re into your Myers-Briggs, then I guess for the INTJ’s this isn’t much of a problem. But whatever.</p>
<p>The politics in the above, then, is the will of expression meeting the will of socialising.<br />
’cause, like. I really want to express my opinion and my viewpoint, but I really also want to keep my friendships and relationships which I value.<br />
And in argument, these two conflict.</p>
<p>What I see with Facebook, I think, is that not-too-subtly people might just post an opinion on their profile.<br />
It’s their domain. And it’s rude to shit on someone’s carpet, or something. So you don’t go and just disagree with someone unless, they-in-their-own-domain, allow things to be disagreed with.<br />
– Clearly I’m more/less inspired by a few occurrences rather than by a general trend.<br />
But anyway. The result on Facebook seems to be people don’t exactly confront the issues so much.</p>
<p>And we, as casual observers to sensible yet diametrically opposed viewpoints, must try and form a rational view, collating the more sensible opinions from these, if we must.<br />
What a difficult task sometimes.</p>
<p>As for Twitter. I don’t know. I suspect it’s rather hard to argue with someone with only 140 characters.<br />
I’d suspect, then, that any Twitter-conflicts would be either a bunch of raw insults, or resource-sharing (‘this-link-proves-you-wrong’).</p>
<p>Tumblr may / may-not be a more interesting site.<br />
I don’t frequent Tumblr, so I can’t say for sure; I don’t know the models of interaction between two users, but you see on the bottom 90% of a popular post “so-and-so reblogged this”.<br />
I’d think this endorses how popularly supported a certain idea/post may be, rather than any demerits or merits of the idea.</p>
<p>Relatedly, Tumblr I suspect is filled with users of a certain culture/society, who spend time within that culture/society.<br />
Quora, from what I observe, very much suffers that same fate. And you can tell I’m not so fond of Quora’s community.</p>
<p>Anyhow.<br />
If it is so “awful to be young”, it’s because the kids-these-days will grow up using the internet in a setting where the popular webpages are social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Tumblr.. and often not really engage in proper arguments.</p>
<p>See, I think the internet-forums I visited were the best at this.<br />
I remember going on a gaming-forum.. it was large enough that it wasn’t a closed community; it wasn’t entirely monolithic, and it wasn’t so large that you couldn’t “get to know” who was who, or vaguely how people would respond to certain things.<br />
There were 12 year olds. There were more mature members. Allsorts.</p>
<p>There were assholes, who seemed to make everything difficult and miserable for everyone. But, since they didn’t break the forum rules, the impartial-yet-present moderators couldn’t do anything about it. There were those who always had dumb opinions.<br />
There were those who had “ok, sure”-but-what-the-fuck opinions, with a cultural attitude so different to your own.<br />
And there were those you admired, whose every post was literary gold, always amusing.</p>
<p>And you’d not know any of them other than by their internet-handle.<br />
And, oh, the arguments. Stupid arguments over the most meaningless of things. But arguments all the same. – I think arguments of this kind are not so unusual in other mediums before the internet.. but, like, it’s the internet which gave rise to Godwin’s Law; which really ought to indicate the nature of these.</p>
<p>My fascination with logic and such is not solely because of my time spent on some internet forum.<br />
(Popular theory at the moment is the INTJ-ness. I recall seeing the statement “INTJs, tragically, just want people to make sense”. But anyway).<br />
But clearly, I think something really is lost, (a healthy experience of argument?), on the social media sites these days.</p>
