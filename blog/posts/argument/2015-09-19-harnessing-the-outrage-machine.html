</div>

<p>South Park’s S19E1 episode, introducing the ‘PC Principal’, seemed to have upset some people. (e.g. <a href="https://twitter.com/thewtfmagazine/status/644391652354879488">this tweet</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/94_jasy/status/645026598488555520">this tweet</a>.<br />
– For what it’s worth, the episode doesn’t say ‘political correctness is bad’, nor ‘social justice is bad’, and it certainly isn’t pandering to say these things are great. - The episode clearly attacks the disproportionate, abusive, bullying endorsed by the “social justice bullies” (as <a href="https://medium.com/@aristoNYC/social-justice-bullies-the-authoritarianism-of-millennial-social-justice-6bdb5ad3c9d3">aristoNYC’s piece</a> termed it).<br />
The term “Social Justice Warrior” is itself.. fun, since many who endorse its characteristics don’t see it as pejorative: ‘Warrior for Social Justice? How could that be a bad thing?’. (Even aristoNYC’s piece, a pretty good article criticising SJWs, likes the term. Thus, “SJ Bullies”).<br />
– South Parks’ contribution to the lexicon here is ‘great’: <a href="https://twitter.com/SouthPark/status/644377482129371136">“You PC bro?”</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/SouthPark/status/644377056021602304">“It’s not BRUCE fucking Jenner, it’s Caitlyn and she’s a fucking stunning woman!”</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/SouthPark/status/644331288426483713">“WOO WOO WOO! You hear that!? That’s the sound of 2015 pulling you over people!”</a> are all sure to be copy-pasted over as height-of-wit when people see someone being a bully. (I do like that last one, it captures the tone of ‘call out’ amazingly well).</p>
<p>Prominent YouTube account GameTheory recently released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPpBlDaKM_o">this video</a>, pointing out that when the media calls gamers “12 year old losers”, it garners a reaction of outrage. (e.g. Jimmy Kimmell managed to get 3x videos in a row, with very little creativity, each getting more views than his channel usually gets, just calling gamers “12 year old losers”).<br />
The video also features the cliche quote of “first they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they fight you, then you win” or so. YMMV.<br />
– But the interesting part of the video was from ~10:30ff, when it was pointed out media sensationalism over ‘shark attacks’ were able to create widespread fear of sharks. Such a fear is irrational and unfounded. Another example it pointed out was the media as the chief culprit of the downfall-into-obscurity of some presidential candidate. – I’m not sure how accurate these examples are of how powerful the media can be, but “media’s lens on insignificant issues has an impact on public perception” is somewhat disconcerting.</p>
<p>Surely there’s room for some level of introspection, to be able to say “hey, I’m outraged by this.” then “does it matter?”, and calm down or so?</p>
<p>I’m not quite talking about <a href="https://medium.com/@julien/the-complete-guide-to-not-giving-a-fuck-52bc4be9e7c1">“not giving a fuck”</a>.<br />
– Certainly “let’s ignore all negative feedback, because there’s NOTHING I can do about it” sounds like a terrible idea. (It’s not what the author <em>means</em>, but it’s a conclusion which could be <em>read</em> from it all the same).</p>
<p>– For what it’s worth, I also think “calming down” by way of cat pictures &amp; other cute things in between bouts of outrage seems a technique to make ‘online bezerkers’: if the outrage is never discussed-through, doesn’t that make it easier to increase tensions?</p>
<p>Anyway.<br />
It seems to me some of the common ways to get an affiliate (of whatever) enraged at a speaker/article:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Unflattering misrepresentation</li>
<li>Unflattering accurate representation</li>
<li>Unflattering reality (for the affiliate)</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m just pulling this out of my ass, so. (Another good way to get an affiliate aroused is some anecdote/story which supports their view of reality: “something bad happened, but if people like me were in charge, it wouldn’t have happened”).<br />
– ‘Being outraged’ is not a particularly sensible response to <em>any</em> of these things. But I suppose if they ‘hurt’ you, you gotta ‘hurt’ them back, right?</p>
<p>– Since being abstract is awful, let me try the above in the context of the South Park episode: it’s upsetting to fans of Social Justice that the ‘PC Bros’ are the ‘bad guys’ (unflatting misrepresentation of ‘social justice’), but also hits close-to-home the vicious nature of SJ bullying online (unflattering accurate representation). – I’ve also seen comments along the lines of how ‘transphobic’ the episode was; perhaps the bullies find it upsetting that not everyone things Jenner is a hero?</p>
<p>Issues which polarise are polarising further than they have before, it seems to me.</p>
