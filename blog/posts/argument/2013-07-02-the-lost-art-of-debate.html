<p>Argument is something I’ve a wee fascination with, in a love/hate kind of way.<br />I think I can say, without being prejudicial or snobbish, that I never like listening to a poor argument.</p>
<p>So worth watching in this area in Michael Sandel’s video at TED, <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/michael_sandel_the_lost_art_of_democratic_debate.html">“The Lost Art of Democratic Debate”</a>.</p>
<p>For those who haven’t encountered Sandel, he’s the fella who lectures in <a href="http://www.justiceharvard.org/">Harvard’s Justice</a> online videos. (They’re probably a fair investment in time, but they’re absolutely fantastic).</p>
<p>The aforementioned TED video features a butchered-down version of one of his lectures, wherein Sandel gives a response for the question “Give the best flute to whom?”.<br />The typical audience to this was “Give the best flute to the best flute player, for the greatest good (to the greatest number)”.<br />Sandel says the philosopher Aristotle would agree with the answer, but disagree with the reasoning.</p>
<p>Ari would’ve said, instead, that the whole point of a good flute is to be played by a good player; it would be a waste of purpose if the flute were not played to its best.</p>
<p>Sandel then brings up an example about a dispute in golfing.<br />More/less: A golfer with disability in the legs contested he was at a disadvantage to play golf if he wasn’t allowed to use a golfing cart; the rules made out, however, that walking between courses was an important part of the game.</p>
<p>This all relates to Aristotle going on about the purpose of things in that, whether a golfer should be able to make use of a golf cart relates to the purpose of the sport.<br />(The dispute about walking as physical exertion is important for golf since, as Sandel quips, golfers are a little touchy about the status of golf as an athletic sport).<br />Sandal discusses that the rulings of the courts were about just that: the purpose of the sport.</p>
<p>Sandal’s wider point, then, is a bit more focus could be brought about in debates when we discuss the purpose of things.</p>
