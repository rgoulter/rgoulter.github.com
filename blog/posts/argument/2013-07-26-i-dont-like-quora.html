<p>I don’t like Quora.</p>
<p>That’s a really negative thing to say, and I should go on to qualify and justify that opinion and all.<br />
Maybe there’s a more positive way to express the sentiment.</p>
<p>For certain there are technical reasons why Quora isn’t my thing.<br />
Total lack of privacy about questions is one. On Quora, were I to follow questions or topics about, say, botany or teddy-bears, then it’s for the whole world to see that I like those things. - For those who pursue their interests on Quora, there’s no privacy as to what they’re interested in. (That also leads to a degree of self-censorship. I’m not gonna go look up questions which I wouldn’t want others to know I’ve looked at). - The onus should be on Quora to protect my privacy, not on me to be careful about what I do.</p>
<p>But even issues like that make Quora a website I wouldn’t want to use, rather than a website I dislike.</p>
<p>What makes Quora such an awful website are its people; and the attitudes people who regularly use Quora have.<br />
The original Q&amp;A which led me to this conclusion, alas, I’ve since misplaced. (EDIT: found it. <a href="http://www.quora.com/Why-do-some-people-prefer-to-spend-time-on-Quora-rather-than-Facebook/answer/Varsha-Iyer?srid=Xq79&amp;share=1">Clearly if you think like this, you’re an asshole</a>. 900 upvotes and counting..). But it’s not hard to dig up foul attitudes in questions like <a href="http://www.quora.com/Quora/Why-do-I-feel-so-at-home-on-Quora-and-so-alienated-on-Facebook">this</a>, <a href="http://www.quora.com/Facebook-1/Why-is-Facebook-so-boring-these-days">this</a> or <a href="http://www.quora.com/Why-is-Quora-so-much-more-engaging-than-Facebook">this</a>.<br />
Clearly I was digging in a topic which reveals the nasty inhumanity of Quora users; but there is a definite, consistent pattern from a variety of users across those questions: that Quora is where you go to be clever and Facebook is where the less-inspired go.<br />
(To be fair, I was amazed to see the comment “ah, Quora circlejerk” on one of these nasty responses. That’s perhaps the best summary of Quora in a phrase).</p>
<p>It’s probably true that a question-and-answer context contains more intellectual substance than the average Facebook newsfeed.<br />
Yet I feel so many of the questions which get shared on Quora defeat the purpose of broad Q&amp;A; questions which might as well be article titles.<br />
Sampling from my newsfeed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“What are 10 algorithms one must know in order to solve most algorithm challenges/puzzles?”</p></li>
<li><p>“What are the best topics to be followed by a programmer in Quora?”</p></li>
<li><p>“What are the best examples of people cheating the system?”</p></li>
<li><p>“What are the most profound jokes made by Joey Tribbiani and Chandler Bing throughout the series? ”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Wow, I didn’t quite notice how monotonous the questions were; but truly, drop the “What are” from the beginning, and you have what sound like reasonably interesting article titles. (Like what folk would share on Facebook).</p>
<p>What loses my respect for regular users of Quora isn’t that they like interesting and intelligent content; it’s their contempt for the common and uninteresting things they perceive on Facebook.<br />
That’s a bad attitude to hold; not only because “the bell tolls for thee” and all, but to me it just seems a rejection of humanity, or of all things human. The crap people write on Facebook is social. Perhaps full of shit, perhaps stupid to the last, but social anyhow.<br />
I’d reckon if you think you’re better than someone else because they’re going about, being human, you’d have to be a right-prick..</p>
<p>But. Even worse, perhaps, is the attitude of “just remove the Facebook friends which don’t interest you”.<br />
Okay; if you’re going to give any weight to the role and status of “Facebook friend”-ing, then I’d have to say there’re more reasons to add/remove someone as friends than just whether their interactions interest you or not.<br />
The crime to be careful of here, though, is that you narrow your view of society, of what it is to be a social human being, by censoring out the stuff you don’t like. - Very much the “Quora circle jerk” is people who like Quora boosting the morale of others who like Quora; bias endorsing bias.<br />
The notion that you’re above the company of others, that they’re not worth talking to is not a particularly healthy notion to embrace.</p>
