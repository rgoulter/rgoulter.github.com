<p>Jane Austen strikes me as quite the bastard, from the stories she tells.<br />
I mean that in an appreciative way.</p>
<p>And I think the adaptations I’ve seen of Jane Austen’s work are <em>happy</em>, &amp;
don’t tend to show so much of an angry, bitter side to them.</p>
<h3 id="pride-and-prejudice">Pride and Prejudice</h3>
<p>Take Caroline Bingley, for example:<br />
She’s (maybe) the girl Darcy would’ve ended up with if not for Elizabeth coming
onto the scene.<br />
There’s this one sentence, as Caroline is goading Darcy at Pemberly: “Miss
Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave
no one any pain but herself.”. – While Caroline is in many ways unpleasant and
unsympathetic, this one sentence show’s the author has a very strong empathy
for her. – &amp; I think in these modern adaptations, which aren’t angry or
bitter, the same intimate sense of empathy is lost.<br />
I think her disingenuous, arrogant and manipulative nature make her less
endearing to the reader; the heart doesn’t bleed for her as an “unrequited
lover”.</p>
<p>– “Austen has empathetic understanding of an unsympathetic character. Surely
that means she’s <em>not</em> a bastard?”.<br />
Kindof. It shows Austen’s <em>capable</em> of such portrayals; and she’s got a sharp
mind.<br />
This sharp mind isn’t so generous to other characters:</p>
<p>I’m grateful to Lizzie Bennett Diaries for going out of its way to highlight
the very-famous opening line of Pride &amp; Prejudice. The sentence nod’s to
Austen’s sarcasm; but it’s kindof hard to tell what exactly the sarcasm is
targeting.<br />
(I recently came across the term “<a href="http://catb.org/jargon/html/H/ha-ha-only-serious.html">ha ha only
serious</a>”. I think
Austen’s scathing wit is an example of this).</p>
<p>For a story which features rich &amp; titled marrying lower-class, Charlotte’s
solution is awfully bitter. (That her best shot is marrying a man she doesn’t
know; the less she knows the better!).</p>
<p>The Bennett’s are a complete mess.<br />
And one might lazily say P&amp;P involves “first impressions aren’t always correct”
(e.g. Darcy seems a twit, but is noble; Wickham seems charming, but is an
asshole), many characters are never shown to improve.<br />
Mrs Bennett is a complete fool. That’s not a hard point to argue.<br />
Mr Bennett comes up short here, too, which gets a bit interesting: ostensibly,
Mr Bennett is “sensible”, and Lizzie and Jane get their sense from him; that
the family can’t provide for themselves is ‘blamed’ on hoping for a boy. –
See, while it’s clear Mrs Bennett is a poor matriarch, Mr Bennett is
uninterested in crafting sense into his daughters, not interested in managing
the household; he’s hardly a great father.</p>
<p>But in terms of “Jane Austen is a bastard”, Lydia is a character who gets cut
out these days:<br />
– While in many ways, P&amp;P can be considered ‘feminist’: the conflict of having
no male heir, Charlotte’s jaded cynicism of marriage; Elizabeth’s strong
independence &amp; intelligence, her exertion of choice as to who she wants to
marry (even refusing the rich, well-titled individual!)..<br />
Lydia’s character very much is not ‘feminist approved’.<br />
It’s not so much that Lydia eloped with a man outside marriage. – Her
unrepentant, unaware self-indulgence are every bit as much condemned by Austen
as Mr Collins’ obscene flattery, or Lady de Bourgh’s patronising.<br />
– I don’t see that Austen would fix that these days: girls shouldn’t be like
Lydia; girls are made to be greater than that. – Boys shouldn’t be like
Wickam; boys are made to be greater than that.</p>
<p>Or, simply put, Lydia is a stupid slut. And authors these days, (especially
Good Feminist ones) don’t write characters like that.</p>
<hr />
<p>I came across a post the other day where some people said “hey, y’know what, I
don’t see what’s so great about Darcy.”.<br />
I like this. Let me never argue that anyone <em>must</em> love Darcy as a character.<br />
But I think it fits my point: if Austen isn’t the ‘nicest’ of people, Darcy is
more of an ‘acquired taste’ than prince-charming on the white-horse.<br />
– It seems more honest for women to admit that the shy-introvert male isn’t
their favourite of heroes, y’see.</p>
<p>But for me, I adore the first proposal scene between Darcy and Elisabeth.<br />
It’s so, so good. – Darcy confesses, “most ardently”; yet, steps on
Elisabeth’s pride as he does this. As the conflict escalates, Elisabeth hits
back every bit as hard as she gets.<br />
It hurts. It’s honest and brutal between them.<br />
Austen’s written Darcy to be a total prick to this point. And Elisabeth, though
brilliant, has been blind to the merits of Darcy’s perspective. – So after the
fight, Darcy aims to be more gentlemanly; Elisabeth feels the shame of
supporting Wickham, etc. – They each improve, thanks to each other.</p>
<h3 id="emma">Emma</h3>
<p>Whenever I mention “Emma”, the usual response is “oh, I hated Emma.”.<br />
(If you don’t <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeeXkf8LZ_8">hate the first 5s of the 1st
episode</a> of Emma Approved, you
mightn’t understand – I can’t tell if that’s a win for Joanna Sotomura or
not).<br />
I dunno about that. Emma is my favourite female character ever: she’s a
top-notch, top-class character … misapplied, not living up to her potential;
realises her own faults, and improves on these.</p>
<p>– “Clueless” as an adaptation does this amazingly.</p>
<p>It seems to me Austen strongly dislikes the pretty-boys. They turn out to be
cads.<br />
Emma is the same character, but well-situated. She gets by, without needing to
apply herself. The world is handed to her on a platter.<br />
– I think that’s “ha ha only serious” in the same kind of way as other Austen
things: that the setting has a beautiful woman treated specially, it’s hard to
tell who the target of the sarcasm is. – But there’s the scathing cry: demand
people apply themselves. Of Emma, that she was made to be greater.</p>
<p>– Fortunately, since Emma’s clueless-ness is embedded in the plot, so
adaptations kinda-have-to include that bastard-ness.</p>
<h3 id="ha-ha-only-serious">“Ha Ha Only Serious”?</h3>
<p>There’s kindof an important element to Austen’s scathing wit, here:</p>
<p>She’s more ready to criticise and lambaste characters (albeit <em>human</em>
characters) than she is to praise. – Yet, the “hard to tell what her sarcasm
is about” is apparently an important part of this. It’s not that Austen doesn’t
have ‘nice’ things to say. She rewards the characters who are humble,
self-aware and self-improving.</p>
<p>But some of the very recent adaptations of Austen’s work decide to add a little
flavour of their own to things. Adding positive characters in support of some
ideology. – Such an attitude is more likely to be a character Austen mocks as
excessive than a character rewarded for modesty.<br />
– In “Emma Approved”, the Frank-and-Fairfax sidestory resolves with the
compromise wherein the man changes everything about himself to get the girl.
Sure. What was amusing was the split reaction to Jane’s
overbearing-righteousness towards Frank; some seeing it as perfectly reasonable
that she would, with great fickleness, switch between adoration and getting
angry/upset with him for having a job she didn’t like. – In any case, in “Emma
Approved”, the author gives Jane’s ideology a blessing; not very Austen-like of
the story to do that.</p>
