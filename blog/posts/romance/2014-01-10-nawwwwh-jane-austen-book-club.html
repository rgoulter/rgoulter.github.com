<p>I liked this movie.<br />It’s about readers, kindof. In a loose kindof way, about books and writers and readers and the ethos and relationships and interactions these have..<br />Of readers and their passion, and their prejudice, their interpretation and projection, their snobby-ness or naivety, knowledge or ignorance..</p>
<p>- And I love that meta-shit like writers writing about writers, or about loving books.<br />Or at least some narrative about readers. :-) And as a reader to ‘read’ a narrative about readers is cute, too.</p>
<p>Although just as I’m likely to like <em>that</em>, I’m just as likely to dislike parts of it.<br />There seems to be a zealous fever in favor of Jane Austen and how amazing Austen is. Appealing to <em>that</em> makes me feel the narrator is appealing to the zealotry (to “Austen fans”), rather than … I don’t know. Rather than ‘to readers’? – What I mean is, I dislike narrations which try and have value to some group of people, simply based on what this people likes. e.g., I reckon the later Harry Potter books are liked so well simply because they’re “Harry Potter”, and not just good narratives.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>I think there are many moments in the film which are adorable.<br />The recommendations to the new acquaintance. (“Oh, you should read.. ..you’ll love it!”).<br />The story of how one first came to read the genre.<br />The willful(?) ignorance of a genre one hasn’t read; (“sci fi is all ‘spaceships and aliens’ … not about real people”). How’s one to know if one likes something or not if one doesn’t try it?<br />Reading a book until the last chapter at night. Reading a book all in one night. Being so excited and immediately reading the next book..</p>
<p>…I dunno. :-) It’s a cute movie.</p>
