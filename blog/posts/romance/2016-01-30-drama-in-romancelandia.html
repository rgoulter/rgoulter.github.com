<p>One doesn’t tend to think of romancelandia as discordant.<br />
Perhaps I’ve not been reading romances long enough. You’d also think that a genre set on characters having Happily Ever Afters, where characters get along after conflicting disagreeing with each other (&amp; where the problem is <em>almost always</em> “poor communication”), wouldn’t have a problem with authors getting along with each other.</p>
<p>Despite this, <a href="http://www.courtneymilan.com/ramblings/2016/01/29/speaking-up-against-systemic-racism-in-the-publishing-industry/">here</a> we see a woman (who is <em>very sympathetic to the cause</em>) being bullied because of an infraction.<br />
Surprise, surprise.<br />
<a href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/features/new-year-new-reading-resolutions/">This</a> being the “incriminating” post in question, by the way.<br />
– Dumas probably isn’t the first person thrown under the bus ‘for the greater good’. And she certainly won’t be the last in the romance community.</p>
<p>And, yes, this is very much “bullying”. Or perhaps “harassment”. Take your pick.<br />
Milan isn’t ashamed to admit that she’s not being ‘nice’, because of course she’s being “good”. And presumably, then, the person she’s bullying <em>deserves</em> it. (I wonder if anyone in history bullied another without thinking it deserved?).</p>
<p>But my point isn’t that Milan is bullying a “bad” person. (I think Milan feels quite justified in doing that, it’s very much the activist frame of mind). But that she’s clearly bullying someone who is sympathetic to the cause. – It’s just too bad Dumas’ efforts <em>weren’t enough</em>, that despite being completely in favour of diverse romance (and listing several recommendations of diverse romance, on quite a well-known platform; in addition to other proactive efforts), she wasn’t <em>pure</em> enough. – And such a “with us or against us” attitude is surely concerning. (And considering how damn <em>with them</em> the target is!).<br />
– Aside from the one quote (which she doesn’t link to), Milan never lists actual evidence that Dumas is guilty of a crime; that all the “good people” don’t like her. Just rumours, whispers. And we all believe rumours/whispers, right?</p>
<p>(By the way. If you’re somehow unaware of who Courtney Milan is, my standing recollection of her is <a href="https://twitter.com/courtneymilan/status/629783779175854080">“don’t misgender my dog”</a>, which probably indicates where she stands politically. And while I’m unaware of what Dumas’ infractions are, I did see <a href="https://twitter.com/suleikhasnyder/status/663197701715206144">this encounter</a> between Suleikha Snyder (<a href="../../posts/romance/2015-08-09-open-letter-regarding-kate-breslins-for-such-a-time-and-diversity-in-romance.html">who came up in my last post about romancelandia drama</a>) and her, where Dumas is lambasted for using the phrase “namaste” while having the audacity to be born white. So.).</p>
<p>– If Milan’s treatment of someone <em>on her side</em> is so angry, <a href="https://twitter.com/courtneymilan/status/692469486591569921">her ranting</a> can hardly surprise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And! Not only that! The post then goes on to explain that the author’s GOAL is to reach those people [who don’t read diverse romance]. The racists.</p>
<p>Um, hell no.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. Bobbi is reaching out to people who don’t read diverse romance, recommending diverse romances for them. – Maybe I’m a little dim, in that I don’t see the crime there.</p>
<p>Anyway, as to the trend of the socially-conscious bullying other socially-conscious women, one could say such “friendly fire” is a trend in domains <a href="http://uberfeminist.blogspot.co.uk/2015/10/friendly-fire-demise-of-social-justice.html">other than romancelandia</a>. I think, though, that’d be dragging a heavy baggage of politics into it, so it’s probably best to not go there.</p>
<p>One could also draw comparisons to other recent controversies about diversity and representation in entertainment; each side arguing to the other that <em>they’re</em> the ones who care about “diversity”, and LGBTQ+ people. I think there’d be even more baggage to that, though, so. – I suspect romancelandia isn’t going to get to such an intense divide, though.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rwa.org/p/bl/et/blogid=20&amp;blogaid=1404">The RWA so delicately</a> described the above issue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Romance Writers of America’s Board of Directors is aware of a difference in opinion regarding a column from a well-known reviewer on the subject of diversity and members of RWA who did not agree with the reviewer’s treatment of the subject.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apparently a prominent author bullying women online isn’t a violation of the RWA code of ethics, so it’s not RWA’s job to pick a side when the kids fight on the playground.<br />
Fair enough, then.</p>
<p>– Aside from the trend in general, regarding Dumas, and Milan’s post specifically:<br />
Even if Dumas <em>weren’t</em> in favour of diversity, so what? There seems to be this nice thought that what’s “fair” and “equal” should win. (Which is where you get posts like <a href="http://blog.leeandlow.com/2016/01/26/where-is-the-diversity-in-publishing-the-2015-diversity-baseline-survey-results/">this</a> lamenting lack of anything not-straight, not-white. (Lack of “not-male” in publishing doesn’t concern the “it’s about equality” crowd, but anyway)). I dunno. If it’s true that more readers are black women, and people love buying books which fit their identity, then it makes sense that publishers (big or indie - we have the internet these days, don’t we?) stand to make more money by catering to a hitherto under-supplied market. And those who don’t want the money are free to not have it, I suppose.<br />
– And if the market leads to the injustice that “what’s popular” doesn’t align with “what’s good or well-written” or “what’s diverse”, what use is it bullying some reviewer about it? (For fun? What’s it going to accomplish, aside from sowing bitterness?).</p>
<p>Yet, aside from such drama.. it’s disappointing to see romancelandia split like this. You’d think those of the genre-of-great-characters could do better. More constructively or collaboratively.</p>
