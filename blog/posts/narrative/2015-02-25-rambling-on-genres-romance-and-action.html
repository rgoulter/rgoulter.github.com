<p>Lately, I’ve been reading lots of RASalvatore. Specifically, his Legend of Drizzt series. I’ve read the first 11 books so far.</p>
<p>I enjoy them well enough. They’re sword-and-sworcery stories, falling roughly under action/adventure and scifi/fantasy genres.<br />What I don’t enjoy is RASalvatore’s characters, for the most part. And so generally any monologue Drizzt has, or any morality consideration (usually early on in the books) is pretty awful. – By the end of the book, the action &amp; adventure is fantastic; unputdownable. Yet at the start, it’s unpickupable!</p>
<p>I’ve heard somewhere, can’t remember where, that the Romance-Novel genre does characters really well, but plot not so much. It seems here that RASalvatore does plot (at least, action/adventure) well, but characters not so much.</p>
<p>There’s more to story-telling than plot + character. e.g. setting comes into it. And these things aren’t discreet, but related &amp; all. (I mean, how d’you have a plot without any characters?). Sure.<br />And I’ve read RNs which have poor characters. Sure.</p>
<p>– I wonder if a ‘best of both worlds’ is possible?</p>
<p>RASalvatore does try ‘romance’, too. It doesn’t really work. e.g. the main characters Drizzt and Cattie-Brie go adventuring with each other for many years; despite admitting to each other they have feelings for each other, they put it off (for some reason). – Clearly the love between them isn’t the kind which is so passionate so as to defy “what’s for the best”. <strong>Zzzzz</strong>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the plots I’ve read in RNs, in terms of action/adventure, haven’t been earth-shatteringly exciting. The cliche is that there’s a kidnapping at the end.<br />– I have read RNs where the characters had to get away while under enemy fire. But in terms of the ‘action/adventure’, let’s go on a quest, rollercoaster of osbstacles-from-nowhere and rescues-from-nowhere, RNs don’t invest much.</p>
<p>That’s not inherently a bad thing; that’s not to say that RNs are inherently without tension.<br />– Sure, in recent RNs you’re guaranteed that the Hero and Heroine have a Happily-Ever-After. But in action/adventure you can be sure the good guys win in the end. Even killing off a main character in S&amp;S/SFF, you can probably bet that the character will be brought back.</p>
<p>Perhaps worth mentioning is Sherry Thomas. I’m not sure if she’s a unique candidate in this position, but Sherry’s written many RNs. Recently, her books have been a wuxia-epic-thing (in two parts), as well as “young adult” adventure/SFF.<br />I thought the wuxia was a bit of a miss; but her SFF series is top notch.</p>
<p>In “The Perilous Sea”, Sherry keeps the plot going by alternating between “present” and “past” events. Moreover, in the tradition of magical-flavoured adventure, builds up a repetoire of “this magic does this”, so the climax of the narrative can get resolved in what would otherwise be cheating.<br />It’s good.<br />But more than “the characters don’t suck” (which is a pretty low bar to set), Sherry’s characters do alright with a romance.</p>
<p>– I suppose the trick is this. In a typical action/adventure story, there’s plenty of time early on where not much is happening. (Perhaps not in the last book of a trilogy/quartet, but anyway). Sherry uses this space for introducing the conflict in the romance of the characters, then slips in the sweet (&amp; bittersweet) developments in the romance during the narrative.<br />I’m not sure Perilous Sea can stand on its own as a Romance Novel; I’m not sure there’s enough meat to it.</p>
<p>In contrast, I don’t think Salvatore sits on his arse. Of the stories I’ve read, it’s been interesting to see him narrate the dark-elf city Menzoberrenzan (or whatever, who cares), and the political tensions &amp; intrigue of the city. It’s got vitality. His establishing descriptions of Important Places such as Calimport create a vivid setting.<br />But definitely the crafting of character isn’t done as well as Sherry’s.</p>
<p>Perhaps it’s just that Salvatore sucks at writing character (mostly), but this weakness hardly matters in an action/adventure story. Similarly, where plots in RNs are less than thrilling, it’s not a large impact to the quality of the story as a whole.</p>
