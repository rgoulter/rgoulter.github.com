<p>Last weekend I went and saw <em>Zootopia</em>.<br />
Today a mate of mine bantered with me about the movie. Which is a push enough to get me to jot down some thoughts.</p>
<p>Spoilers follow.<br />
But I don’t think there’s much to spoil.</p>
<p>I’d heard only good things about <em>Zootopia</em> going in, and how amazing it was. After seeing <em>Inside Out</em>, I guess my standards for a “kids movie” is much higher.<br />
In terms of quality of the story, both <em>Zootopia</em> and <em>Inside Out</em> are pretty generic; but <em>Inside Out</em> wins in my book because it’s inherently more meta, &amp; it’d be more precise to say the constituent-substories are each generic. – <em>Inside Out</em> is also really sharp, very intelligent.<br />
– But what’s cool about both these movies is they present a compelling <em>setting</em>. These settings serve as good platforms from which to discuss other ideas, external to the story. (<em>Inside Out</em>’s credits even feature such extension).</p>
<p>Where <em>Inside Out</em>’s context is “emotions neurology-brain-stuff” (as well as dealing with sorrow), <em>Zootopia</em> tackles “diversity”.<br />
– From mainstream bias to “women in tech” &amp; “the wage gap”, I was expecting propaganda along the lines of “yay diversity is great”. – What <em>Zootopia</em> delivers is … not that. ish.</p>
<p>Brief aside, just so we’re clear on <em>Zootopia</em>’s setting:<br />
<em>Zootopia</em> is is like an alternative universe where modern world is populated by anthropomorphic animals, rather than humans. – Animals are divided between Predators and Prey. In time immemorial, the predators were the oppressors of the oppressed prey. In modern, civilised times, the animals have evolved to a supposed “egalitarian society, where anyone can be anything”. But things aren’t equal in Zootopia-city.<br />
Worth noting further, certain animals have stereotypes or stigmas attached to them (foxes are sly/deceiving; rabbits are weak, carrot-farmers). The society in Zootopia is also extremely segregated. (e.g. elephants, presumably, don’t live in the same housing blocks as hamsters).<br />
– For all I felt the film lacked; the setting is an interesting (if not an extreme or polemic) one.</p>
<p>Ostensibly, <em>Zootopia</em> does have a nice-sounding, fuzzy message of “let anyone do anything”:<br />
The oppressed sheep- (prey) and-female assistant-mayor gets pushed around and ignored by the lion-and-male mayor; builds solidarity with the bunny (and female) protagonist by way of “us little guys have to stick out for each other”.<br />
It’s celebrated (by the mayoralty, &amp; narrator) that the protagonist is the first bunny cop; and later, similarly the first sly-fox is also a “yay more diverse police force”.<br />
Prejudice is bad, like when the fox gets rejected (and beaten) for wanting to join the Scouts (dominantly/entirely prey-animals).<br />
And, sure, the fox <em>is</em> a sly deceiver, but only because no one gave him a chance to be otherwise.<br />
– The film ends with Shakira’s “Try Everything”, after a moral-of-the-story like “sure, animals have limits; but don’t let fear of those limits stop you from trying what you want to do”.</p>
<p>(On further thought, even those examples aren’t so black-and-white:<br />
the bunny isn’t the first ‘prey’-animal to be on the police, (Idris Elba’s character is a buffalo, and there’re elephants on the force), merely the first bunny.<br />
And there’s an irony in the ‘prey’-animals of the Scouts beating up the ‘predator’ fox since they fear him to be perfidious and violent. – The recent term “cry-bully” comes to mind).</p>
<p>A small part of my ‘disappointment’ is the cop-out of that moral-of-the-story.<br />
– A key (but plotwise, somewhat contrived) tension in <em>Zootopia</em> was “are predators inherently violent creatures?”. More explicitly, is it justifiable for prey to be concerned that predators they interact with may become violent. “No, don’t be a prejudiced asshole” the movie says, on the one hand. – But on the other hand, the godfather’s bodyguards are all large beefy animals; “anyone can be anything; but you can’t be a bodyguard if you’re a mouse” seems contrary to that.<br />
The movie never explicitly says “it is good and just that the police force is filled with the strong animals”, but never denies that there’re reasons for such inequalities.<br />
(Of course, in real life, differences in ability aren’t inherently as pronounced as between mice and elephants. I’d never be able to beat Usain Bolt in a sprint; but it’s not that any particular job is inherently best for some particular group of people by orders-of-magnitude differences).<br />
– Perhaps best to say that the film’s <em>setting</em> is nuanced, even if it’s plot mightn’t be.</p>
<p>I think it didn’t quite explore the ‘edge’ cases quite far enough.<br />
In tensions like “women in tech”, “the wage gap” and such, it’s often suggested that women’s preferences differ from men; e.g. women are interested in people-things rather than mechanical-things, or women prefer jobs which offer flexible hours over jobs which demand high availability. – <em>Zootopia</em>’s mapping of this is interesting: the rabbits (except the protagonist) prefer to be carrot farmers; the protagonists parents suggesting “it’s the way nature intended” (or so), but this also comes across as old-fashioned.<br />
– I mean, in a movie where the characters are <em>very</em> different, I’m not handing out cookies if the movie has a moral like “people are different and we should tolerate that”. Cookies are for where we should tolerate bad people; or where differences should be tolerated. – And, sure, it’s a kid’s movie; but those tough questions are what you’d try and illuminate with such a model.</p>
