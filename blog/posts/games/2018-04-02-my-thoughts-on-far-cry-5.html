<p>So I put my nice gaming PC to use and played through Far Cry 5.</p>
<p>I’ve enjoyed the Far Cry 3-ish series of Far Crys.<br />
They can fairly be accused of being ‘bland’. (Those, and other Ubisoft sandbox games, like Ghost Recon Wildlands; although I didn’t play it).<br />
I think FC5 manages to pack a bit of flavour into its gameplay without being entirely bland.</p>
<p>Anyway.<br />
It’s set in some rural part of America with crazy cultish gun-nuts as the bad guys.<br />
I saw that game reviewers disliked its story for not being, idk, “Trump is bad” or whatever. lol.</p>
<p>All the same, the ending to the story is a bit annoying.<br />
It’s annoying enough to be worth spoiling.<br />
Recall that in Far Cry 3, there’s a north island, and a south island; the player liberates the north island before going on to liberate the south island. FC4 followed the same formula.<br />
Far Cry 5 is more open. The map is divided into three areas, each must be liberated before facing a final boss for that region. Each region has a slightly different flavour of enemies. And each boss has their own quirks as they menace the player liberating the island.<br />
Well. The game ends with the more-foresight-than-God final boss winning over the player.</p>
<p>This is annoying because it’s a stupid ‘surprise’ twist; but it doesn’t feel like a particularly foreshadowed or established twist.<br />
When liberating each three regions, the player is repeatedly captured by the baddies in the region. It’s scripted and unavoidable, but it’s also decided by the story that the player beats them.<br />
– So that the player doesn’t get to beat the mighty big bad final boss is just kindof a “look I tricked you” twist, but inconsistent with the established rules.<br />
– The closest I can see it to ‘fair’ is that at the beginning the player gets randomly rescued; so that the player gets randomly defeated at the end has a very “God giveth, God taketh-away” kinda ring to it. But, eh…</p>
<p>It’s kindof natural for Far Cry and such to have ludo-narrative dissonance.<br />
A disconnect between the story and the gameplay.<br />
Like. In the game. If your allied characters get shot, you can ‘revive’ them; or you can call them back into battle after 15 minutes. – In such a context, it’s difficult to sympathise when the story says “nah, this character got shot and dies”.</p>
<hr />
<p>The gameplay itself is pretty fun.<br />
I think it’s fair to call it the “Far Cry sandbox formula refined”.</p>
<p>It definitely felt like the game-story didn’t get in the way of the sandbox gameplay as much as previous games had.</p>
<p>The sandbox is filled with toys to play with.<br />
e.g. “outposts” which are occupied by enemy troops, but can be ‘liberated’.<br />
e.g. various objective-based missions can be played. e.g. different “prepper stashes” are dotted around, which are usually hidden behind some kind of puzzle.</p>
<p>I kindof felt the game had fewer weapons than previous iterations.<br />
Part of that was they dropped the “special” weapons (which were enhanced versions of regular weapons, that had to be unlocked). – These were dropped in favour of a microtransaction system. Oddly, the microtransactions are for nice weapon skins. But these can also be purchased for a moderate amount of in-game effort. (It’s not an unreasonable amount of effort. But it’s just weird, ’cause I can’t imagine who would spend money on them, they’re strictly cosmetic).</p>
<p>The sandbox mechanics of ‘liberating’ an outpost can be summarised as “try and stealthily kill the enemies, until you get spotted, in which case charge in all guns blazing”.<br />
The tool for this job is the silenced sniper rifle. So, easily the best gun in the game for most tasks is the first sniper rifle that can be unlocked.<br />
Pretty much every weapon can have a silencer. It’s quite satisfying to face off a bunch of bad guys and ‘bip’ them with headshots without being noticed.</p>
<p>The game also lets you drive helicopters and fighter planes.<br />
These aren’t overpowered, oddly enough, since .. there aren’t that many enemies to shoot.<br />
And they’re not easy to spot/hit from the vehicles.<br />
(Unlike, say, the Saints Row games.. where helicopter gunships in the sandbox were very overpowered).</p>
<p>What <em>was</em> overpowered were the buddies.<br />
Far Cry Primal introduced the ‘buddy’ system. – In that, you would befriend some fierce animal (a tiger, a bear, whatever).. and then later the animal’ would help you in combat.<br />
FC5 keeps this system (albeit, you can’t befriend animals in the wild), but adds other human characters. You can have two buddies at a time, even.<br />
– There are 6 special human characters to buddy with; or you can buddy with a ‘normal’ liberated ally.<br />
The ‘normal’ liberated ally has a more cookie-cutter personality. And some weapon. I saw different characters with rifles, or a bow and arrow, or a shotgun, or a machine gun, or an RPG.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the ‘normal’ liberated ally characters with the RPGs were amusingly stupid.<br />
Like. There were times when there was some enemy right at the feet of the character (a wolf or something); and the guy fired the RPG right at his feet. He killed the enemy, but had to be revived.<br />
– Another time.. there was an encounter with an enemy prisoner van. The expected interaction is to shoot the enemy driver.. or maybe shoot out the tyres from the van; then you can release the prisoners. – RPG-guy saw an enemy van, fired, and blew it up. (The player isn’t penalised for this).</p>
<p>But, yeah, the buddies are generally over-powered.<br />
e.g. they can revive you if you get shot (and they’re still alive).<br />
– The game acknowledges this, by not allowing you to take your buddies on the important story missions.</p>
