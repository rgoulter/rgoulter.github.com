<p>I recently played through Just Cause 3, and had a lot of fun playing that. - I
think, though, that after ‘liberating’ all the towns, collecting all the
collectibles, and completing all the missions, there’s not as much innate
incentive to play the game as I would’ve thought.<br />
Considering Just Cause 3 is a game where you can fly-like-batman, grapple, and
parachute your way around an environment, in addition to blowing-shit-up,
hijacking all kinds of vehicles easily, etc. etc. it’s a bit strange. – I get
the impression it would be fair to describe Just Cause 3 as “a game where you
unlock things, so that you get a fun toy/playground at the end of it”. (e.g.,
unlocking more vehicles to request, or unlocking a higher request-tokens
capacity as you get nearer the end). – So what makes for an interesting ‘toy’
game?</p>
<p>Minecraft is the ultimate ‘toy’ game.<br />
To such an insane extent. Google for it, but you hear of things like people
building BASIC interpreters, or processors, or whatever using the redstone
mechanics.<br />
From what I’ve played, I think why it’s fun like this, more specific than “you
can do anything you want (like farm, or fight)”, is Minecraft involves creating
systems. (e.g. “here is my house, here is where I mine, here is the chest were
I put stuff”). And so the <em>narrative</em> follows from that. “Here’s my mine… I’m
going to mine further”, “here’s my house. I want some glass, so I’m going to
get sand”, “at night, I need to fight my way back to my house, clear the
surrounding area. Or maybe just survive the night through combat”. – I suppose
there’s motivation which comes from taking a wild/unordered region (the
generated world), and conquering/colonising it; e.g. tunnelling through the
underground, chopping down trees, terraforming uneven parts of land.</p>
<p>Minecraft is quite, quite different from Just Cause 3, in that the latter is
much more obviously a “game” than the former.</p>
<p>The Saints Row series is much closer to what Just Cause has. (In particular, I
like Saints Row the Third best, but whatever).<br />
Both these games involve having fun from destruction and unrealistic-violence
in a conquerable, open-world setting.<br />
I’ve certainly had a lot of fun screwing around in Saints Row the Third. –
Though, unfortunately, if Saints Row is a better toy, Just Cause is a better
game: the minigames (and missions) in Just Cause aren’t boring.</p>
<p>So what makes Saints Row a better toy?<br />
I wonder if part of it isn’t that in Saints Row, you get the ‘cheats’ like
Invulnerability, Infinite Ammunition <em>in-game</em>. You have to buy them, (&amp; so
there’s strong incentive to play the game to earn the money, etc.). – Free
reign to cause havock and destruction, after earning this by playing the game
‘legitimately’ sounds fun.<br />
And while you can’t construct/modify the environment, so can’t “create systems”
like in Minecraft, Saints Row lets you customise your character and your
character’s things. The character’s body/face/hair, the character’s clothing (&amp;
what colours), the weapons (to an extent), and the cars. – You can choose to
dress your character in all-yellow, driving an all-yellow car if you want. (Why
not, right?). I think your character can even have actually-yellow, also. Or
you can dress up in costume. – I guess that’s very Barbie-doll ish. But it’s
fun.<br />
The setting in Saints Row does lend itself to <em>some</em> narrative-making:
gangsters from your gang will roam the streets, as will gangsters from other
teams, and the police. So you can easily pick fights if you want, &amp; then have a
good ol’ car-chase to escape. There’re also random-events like “defend this
area for 3 waves” which the player can be prompted with.</p>
<p>Just Cause 3 has some of these things that Saints Row has: there will be random
encounters / mini-quests, involving tasks like “hijack this car, then get clear
of your wanted level”. And you can ‘collect’ different vehicles. You can
certainly cause mayhem if you want, &amp; there will be patrols of bad-guys you can
pick fights with every now and then, too.<br />
One (dumb) idea might be, that the enemy would try to re-conquer towns/areas
that the player ‘liberated’. – This would have some narrative, but makes it
quite a chore to keep the whole territory ‘liberated’. – There’s no benefit
from the ‘liberated’ regions that impacts the player much; not like “more
reinforcements to help you” or “hourly cash income”. (Well, the ‘main’ benefit
actually seems to be there aren’t as many bad guys, and you can do ‘suspicious’
things without getting a wanted level. Still). – What I <em>do</em> like from Just
Cause 3 is that you can always have some town/settlement “re-oppressed” so it
can be “re-liberated”.<br />
Perhaps the whole “not using cash to upgrade/unlock stuff” is strange, also..
in that, it <em>demands</em> skill to unlock better features (like “more ammo
capacity”), rather than demanding player spend “more time playing the game”.<br />
– And Just Cause 3 has some cool.. features that lend itself to being a fun
toy, like the tether.<br />
But I wanna be able to customise <em>my</em> car, to be able to tear-shit-up with
infinite-rockets, &amp; screw-around in pew-pew shootouts without worrying too much
about things like ammo, or health. (Which isn’t really a “game”, sure).</p>
<p>All the same, I can’t help but think that a marriage of Just Cause 3 and Saints
Row would be a ridiculously fun carnage-causing sandbox.</p>
