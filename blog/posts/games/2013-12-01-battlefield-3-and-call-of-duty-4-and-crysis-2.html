<p>Ha. Can you tell I just finished exams?<br />
BattleField 3 was one I picked up during one of the Humble Bundles. I’m surprised my laptop can manage to play the game; even on Low-quality graphics settings (which is below what the game auto-analysed my computer for,  bah) it still looks fantastic..</p>
<p>Also, in terms of Single Player, (since BF3 multiplayer became irrelavent when BF4 came out? one would hope..), it’s also quite short. And a bit silly.<br />
I’ve heard BF4 has a better campaign than BF3.</p>
<p>Call of Duty 4 I picked up a while ago. (Not at any great discount; but I’d heard CoD4 is “the good one”).<br />
Also a short game.</p>
<p>– And from games I’ve played recently, it’d be worth comparing Crysis 2 to these ones. (..and not Far Cry 3; that’s rather a different game).<br />
See, while the bulk of my more recent analysis dumps here on the blog have been about open-world designs, these three are shooters. Rather pure shooters, at that. (Although Crysis does dabble a slight bit in terms of RPG-elements; but only slightly).</p>
<p>And. Just because I am that damn pedantic.<br />
Shooters are where you have a gun, and you kill bad guys.<br />
The cool kids say that “modern” shooters aren’t quite as great as the shooters of the late 90’s..</p>
<p>But in terms of gameplay, with these modern-shooters..<br />
If strategy games are fun because you build up a currency.. and open-world games are fun due to a conquest.. these pure-shooter games seem to have a much more ‘raw’ sense of fun in attacking-through hordes of enemies. ( And maybe also the cool-factor of machine-guns and explosions. :-) ).</p>
<p>Anyway. Timeline:<br />
Call of Duty 4 came out in 2007.<br />
Crysis 2 in March 2011, Battlefield 3 in October 2011.<br />
(And the order I played them in? Crysis, CoD, BF3..).</p>
<p>Crysis 2 was the most modern shooter I’d played, when I played it.<br />
It had that thing where you could stealth-stab enemies, with an animation and everything.<br />
I thought that was very “modern shooter” as-in CoD-style; but, in retrospect, Crysis 2 is much more its own game.<br />
It’s silly, and cliche, and the stealth-suit is apparently over-powered.. but it’s really not copy-cat from CoD4.</p>
<p>CoD4?<br />
Hmm.<br />
BattleField 3 copies so much of CoD4’s formula, one might as well consider them as the same game-mechanics. (Their stories differ, and in BF3 you get to [kindof] fly a jet, and drive a tank).<br />
It’s … it’s all very <em>linear</em>.</p>
<p>Far Cry and Crysis 1 branded themselves as open-island type places. – The islands are certainly open enough that there’s variety of experience in choosing different routes for the mission.<br />
Crysis 2, in contrast, is “open” only within each segment of a level. “Open” in that you have a variety of different ways to tackle the obstacles.<br />
(Oh, and the RPG-elements? Crysis kindof-sortof has the upgrades for you to get when you kill the enemies; but I don’t recall it featured too prominently?).</p>
<p>The “linear” epithet CoD4/BF3, as far as I can tell, is just that the Campaign of these games only involves the player following a set path, then more/less directly shooting at the enemies before progressing further.<br />
– What these games offer as an alternative is a strongly-narrated story. The narrator holds your hand, tells you who to kill (or not kill), and along with cutscenes, you end up with a pretty neat interactive work of fiction.</p>
<p>A comparison between linear and non-linear interactive narrations may be interesting.. but that’s rather a different topic, I suppose.</p>
