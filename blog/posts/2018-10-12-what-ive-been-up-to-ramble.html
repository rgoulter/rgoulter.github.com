<p>I haven’t published anything on this blog for some time.</p>
<p>I’ll break that absense with a bit of a ramble.</p>
<p>I’ve just relocated to Vietnam, to live with my girlfriend.<br />
Currently, I’m on a “personal sabbatical”.</p>
<p>The first part of this ‘sabbatical’ has been spent on relocating, and on catching up on some of my Steam backlog.<br />
(I did meet with some of my friends before leaving Singapore, too).</p>
<p>Currently I’m transitioning from “playing games” to “personal organisation”. I’m trying to establish some discipline or deliberateness about how I go about being productive.<br />
One part of that is looking at <a href="https://plaintextaccounting.org">PlainTextAccounting</a> as an improvement on how I have (or haven’t) been tracking where my money goes.<br />
Another aspect of this is to actually make use of the org-files I’ve been dumping content into.</p>
<p>I’ve been fairly good at “write-only notes”. This could be considered as journalling or logging.<br />
I haven’t been good at considering “why?” about these notes. And without a purpose, there’s no cost for the notes not having any structure. (Without structure, it’s expensive to refer to notes; but if you’re not referring to the notes, then this doesn’t matter).</p>
<p>Part of that is fine. You don’t know what the structure/discipline should be until you do it.<br />
But, uh, now I can see that there’s value in: 1) reflecting on what you’re doing, 2) having some criteria to consider when reflecting.<br />
– That sounds rigid; but the point of the structure is to guide and serve, rather than to limit realised potential.</p>
<p>On the topic of “being productive” and disciplined, some interesting media:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cal Newport’s “Deep Work”. What a fascinating book. It criticises the “busy” and distracted modern work environment as detrimental to a craftsman’s work, and suggests rules for how to focus on getting meaningful work done.</p></li>
<li><p>“Getting Things Done”. I haven’t read the book, but. People who like Emacs’ org-mode also seem to like GTD. (org-mode and GTD both seem to be flexible such that they can be used per individual preference).<br />
Compared to “Deep Work”, GTD’s emphasis seems to be on “avoid distraction” by way of: keep track of everything on paper (rather than in your head), and have a process to sort out the things you want to keep track of.</p></li>
<li><p>I finally watched a Joe Rogan podcast with Jordan Peterson as a guest. Seems like JBP often argues in favour discipline &amp; <em>incremental</em> improvement.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Related to this: social media.<br />
I haven’t been spending as much time on social media recently as I used to.<br />
This isn’t a “I’m being disciplined about it” thing.<br />
It’s partly a “not especially interested”; and I think partly I want to organise my social media stuff too.</p>
<p>I’m not particularly negatively affected by “people post their perfect selves on social media”. Albeit, I suppose I’m guilty of posting some good times on social media, which maybe does affect others.</p>
<p>I do find myself drawn-in by e.g. the titles/questions in the Quora Digest emails. (I haven’t thought much about why this annoys me).<br />
I’m also drawn in by the “what’s next? what am I missing out on?” allure of Twitter and Hacker News. (I think Reddit communities have the same draw to them, so I don’t go on Reddit).</p>
<p>Well, uh, yeah, Twitter is probably my favourite social media site for arguments, which I’m fascinated with.<br />
And while the tribalism and culture-war politics is admittedly a big draw for me,<br />
I think another aspect of what I liked about Twitter was its referential nature. Since the 140 characters wasn’t enough to explain or link to any context, tweets would inherently refer to events. As a user, you had to be “in the know” for this to make sense. My experience was often having to puzzle together what people were talking about from various tweets.<br />
There’s a kind of “open to anyone who makes the effort” inclusion to that.</p>
<p>In terms of “organising myself” and “being disciplined”, my concern here is a lack of deliberateness in consumption.<br />
e.g. Spending about an hour looking through various programmer-related discussions on Hacker News or trending GitHub repositories seems fine (especially if it’s an hour I have set aside to do that).<br />
But spending however-long getting mad about slights against my tribe (or dumb things my out-group do) on Twitter until I’ve seen pretty much everything people in my timeline have gotten mad about … doesn’t seem so good.</p>
<hr />
<p>One sensible solution here is “don’t go on Twitter to consume politics if it’s unhealthy for you”.<br />
But I kinda reckon if recommendation-algorithms will naturally find this kindof stuff for me: Instagram’s recommendation manages to show me cartoons with a propaganda-level of political fervour.<br />
– On the other hand: most people are able to move through life and the internet without being politically, tribally worked up about everything. (I’m not sure if this is a case of “once you’ve tasted the forbidden fruit, you can’t go back” kinda thing).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.codesections.com/blog/mastodon-elevator-pitch">CodeSections’s “Mastodon Elevator Pitch”</a> argues in favour of Mastodon essentially as a ‘technical solution’ over Twitters outrage-encouraging site. The incentives of the system are geared to avoid the outrage that Twitter’s induces.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kialo.com/tour/">Kialo</a> is another ‘technical solution’. Kialo is interested in visualising and structuring the arguments on contentious topics.<br />
I haven’t looked at it enough to have much of an opinion; the only one I’ve looked at was <a href="https://www.kialo.com/is-the-last-jedi-one-of-the-weakest-star-wars-movies-so-far-7055/7055.0=7055.1/=7055.1">“The Last Jedi is one of the Weakest Star Wars Movies So Far”</a>. I guess the hope is that, if points must be made (and supported), this doesn’t give much room for emotion to sway perspective. Yet, I still like Haidt’s “reason is the press secretary of the emotions”.<br />
– Perhaps the point of the site isn’t <em>persuasion</em> so much as a dialogue with less heat to it.</p>
<p>For myself, I’d first wonder whether “doing social media slower” would be ‘better’.<br />
Like, instead of a “retweet and this gets retweeted immediately”, a “review in 24 hours, and retweet if I think it’s still a good idea to do that”. But I suspect if shown the same input I’d behave in the same way, and still be mad again 24 hours later.</p>
<p>Another couple of dumb ideas:</p>
<p>I wonder how analogous the “outrage machine” of social media (and its ills to society) is to “herd immunity” with vaccinations.<br />
As in, if a critical mass of people were immune to outrage, or “fake news” or mainstream media clickbait, then the pathogens won’t go viral amongst vulnerable.<br />
– With biological diseases, a vaccine is an inert (or very weak) form of the disease. This strengthens the body so that the actual disease can’t take hold.</p>
<p>I stumbled across a conspiracy-theory video on YouTube once.<br />
I didn’t stay to watch it.<br />
And <em>obviously</em> only idiots fall for conspiracy videos, right?<br />
But, I kinda wonder how much of the crap in those videos I’d fall for.</p>
<p>Another idea,<br />
maybe I’d be less annoyed by dumb tweets or whatever if I took the time to (1) describe why I’m annoyed by it, (2) figure out an explanation for why the dumb tweet was said, in a way that provides dignity.<br />
– Like, maybe trying to code content <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/05/08/varieties-of-argumentative-experience/">to a model like SSC’s “Varieties of Argument”</a> is another way to deal with the emotion?</p>
