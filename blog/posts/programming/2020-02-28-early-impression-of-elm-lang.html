<p>Recently I wrote some Elm-lang code as part of a casual side-project.</p>
<p>The Elm program was simple, though non-trivial.<br />
The program was a UI for making notes from emails. The Elm program presented a list of emails for the user to select, and let the user CRUD a note for the selected email.</p>
<p>Some changesets: - https://github.com/rgoulter/simple-email-data-tool/pull/1/files Initially adding the Elm program with Travis-CI config, RSpec spec with Capybara, and the Elm program. - https://github.com/rgoulter/simple-email-data-tool/pull/5 Changing from a <code>&lt;select/&gt;</code> to a <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> for one of the widgets. (I was surprised by how easy this change was). - https://github.com/rgoulter/simple-email-data-tool/pull/6/files Adding keybindings to the input. - https://github.com/rgoulter/simple-email-data-tool/pull/8/files Adding date filtering, using a third-party pure-Elm library.</p>
<h3 id="where-im-coming-from">Where I’m Coming From</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>I’d be lying if I said I was very experienced with front-end code. e.g. I can’t think of any big mistakes I’ve made and things I’ve learned from said mistakes. The basics are straightforward; and a deep understanding of front-end web development requires an appreciation for all aspects of how a web browser works, which isn’t easy.</p></li>
<li>On the continuum of ‘liberal programmer’ (“if it breaks, just fix it”; likes Python, Ruby) to ‘conservative programmer’ (wants to know if it works at compile time; likes Haskell) I’m towards the ‘conservative’ end.
<ul>
<li>I’m inclined to like Elm.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-i-didnt-like-about-elm">What I Didn’t Like About Elm</h3>
<ul>
<li>I was surprised that some things in Elm were (much) harder than they would be in JavaScript.
<ul>
<li>I wasn’t able to figure out how to nicely access the query parameters of the URI. (I ended up getting something which could access the query parameters at a specific path; but I couldn’t figure it out for any arbitrary path). This is an example of “easy in JavaScript, hard in Elm”.
<ul>
<li>While I found this frustrating, I think the Elm-lang documentation makes it clear <em>why</em> it makes this kind of thing ‘hard’.
<ul>
<li>Elm is all about removing footguns. In this case, easy access to the window’s URI query params would introduce impurity; so, to access window’s URI your Elm program also need to ‘manage’ the URI.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>But I would anticipate further “of <em>course</em> that wouldn’t be straightforward in Elm” when considering Elm as a language.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>e.g. I wouldn’t wanna write this blog website’s page with Elm, since the Elm runtime is JavaScript; so if I used Elm then it wouldn’t be accessible to users with JavaScript disabled.</p></li>
<li><p>I still have to look into idioms or idiosyncracies about combining modules together. I’m not sure I ‘get’ it, or if the approach I took was stupid or fine.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-i-found-interesting-about-elm">What I Found Interesting About Elm</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Elm Architecture. The restricted nature of Elm’s code means that, while code still doesn’t magically end up well designed, it still ends up being somewhat (or close to) idiomatic.
<ul>
<li>My experience with GUIs other than Elm has been with languages that allow you to more/less update the code’s state from anywhere.</li>
<li>With Elm, you have a ‘model’ Algebraic type, a ‘message’ Algebraic type.
<ul>
<li>Anything the Elm program needs to care about goes in its model.</li>
<li>Any ‘action’ that might happen in the Elm program is represented by a message.</li>
<li>The only place the model gets changes is in its update function.</li>
<li>The only way effects happen is through messages.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The question becomes “what nouns, what verbs do I want in this system? What is each noun? What does each verb do?”.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Because of that explicitness and lack of mutation, edge cases (and race conditions) are surfaced.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-i-liked-about-elm">What I Liked About Elm</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>It’s not JavaScript. Programming in JavaScript is .. fine. But I don’t particularly like JavaScript. It feels very blobbish.</p></li>
<li><p>95% of the time it’s a joy to write in Elm. (Most of the time it’s not a joy to write in are the times when you’re trying to do something which would be easy to do in JavaScript. Or with impurity like time/randomness).</p></li>
<li><p>Elm mostly has the “if it compiles it works” aspect to it.</p></li>
<li>Elm programs/modules are self contained and small.
<ul>
<li>Everything you need in a module must be explicitly imported.</li>
<li>The lack of mutation means things are much more explicit.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Elm’s record syntax is nicer than Haskell’s.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="my-development-experience">My Development Experience</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>I mocked the API that my Elm program would call with simple Ruby’s Sinatra servers.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote RSpec specs which would compile the Elm program before running Selenium tests against the Elm program.</p></li>
<li><p>My program wasn’t sophisticated enough to need much development work on components individually. But I did find it easy enough to use “elm reactor” (compiles + serves the Elm source) to focus on one component at a time.</p></li>
<li>I developed my Elm program using Emacs. The most popular elm-mode gave me syntax highlighting. I didn’t feel the need to make use of elm-mode’s other IDE features.
<ul>
<li>For code completion: I developed my Elm program on Windows. There’s an Elm language server. Unfortunately, I think because Windows is slow at launching processes, I found it was too slow for me to use with Emacs on Windows.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I didn’t make good use of it, but there is support in universal-ctags.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="would-i-use-it">Would I Use It?</h3>
<p>After having used it for a side-project, without the burden of needing to ship something reliable by some deadline:</p>
<p>Yes, I’m quite happy with the experience.</p>
<p>Obivously I’m interested in liking it, though; and this wasn’t a high-risk project, so:<br />
What situations/cases would I not recommend using it for?<br />
- Projects which benefit from a rapid prototyping/delivery (e.g. code maintainability/quality can be traded off) by an experienced team which lacks any experience Elm. - Projects which already show evidence of some kind of a “lava flow” antipattern, or projects where using Elm is likely to lead (or contribute) to an anti-pattern like this. - Projects where Elm is chosen without consideration for <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">‘Choose Boring Technology’</a>. - If I were given responsibility to maintain some front-end application code which was poorly written in JavaScript using ReactJS: - While it’s possible to interop Elm and JavaScript, I think the complexity of the same maintainers mixing the code would outweigh benefits of using Elm. - etc.</p>
<p>I think websites would be better maintained if they were developed with the discipline that Elm does a lot to help.</p>
