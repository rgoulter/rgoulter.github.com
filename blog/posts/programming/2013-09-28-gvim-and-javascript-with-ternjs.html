<p>Ok. So after cross-posting the GVim and Java from my NUS blog..</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe">YouCompleteMe</a> not only provides awesome functionality with EClim or Jedi (for Java / Python respectively). Since it can get along with (as I understand things) Vim’s OmniComplete, then YCM works with other intelligent completion things like TernJS.</p>
<p><a href="http://ternjs.net/">TernJS</a>, made by the same guy who did CodeMirror, does some pretty fancy JavaScript jazz, so <a href="https://github.com/marijnh/tern_for_vim">your text editor</a> can (try to) infer a variables type, .. and can provide intelligent autocomplete suggestions.</p>
<p>Married with YCM, the intelligence and fuzzy-completion makes for what must surely be the most powerful JavaScript editing today.<br />(Well, I dunno what the emacs or Sublime kiddies are up to; they might be pretty close too).</p>
<p>But. This was one time where being a total noob left things easier for Windows than for Linux.<br />See, oddly enough, I managed to get this working on Windows while it was still blowing up at me on Linux.<br />(Since I don’t want to battle my OS, I go with Linux Mint 15. I’m pretty sure Linux Mint is what comes up if you Google-search “easiest Linux to use”).</p>
<p>Turns out I had two problems:<br />First was that “node” didn’t actually run NodeJS, since this was changed due to name conflicts. A quick symlink solves this issue..<br />Second was that, since I was too lazy to build NodeJS from source, the version in I was running from the package-repository was ancient. Ancient.</p>
<p>I’ve not tried to build much from source on Windows.<br />By a poor selective case, I understand that <a href="https://bitbucket.org/Haroogan/vim-for-windows/src">trying to build Vim on Windows is a total pain</a> in the arse. <a href="https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/wiki/Building-Vim-from-source">Building it on Linux is really really easy</a>, though.</p>
<p>But I was lazy. Turns out that <a href="https://github.com/joyent/node">to build NodeJS from source</a>, after <a href="http://nodejs.org/">downloading the code</a>, was the stock-and-standard:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./configure  
$ make  
$ sudo checkinstall</code></pre>
<p>Well.<br />I used “checkinstall” rather than “make install”,<br />but that’s all there was to it, anyway.</p>
<p>And with ‘node’ being called as expected, with an actual up-to-date version of Node, TernJS worked like it should! Fantastic.</p>
