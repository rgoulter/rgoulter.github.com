<p>Here are some notes from tinkering with the <a href="https://github.com/WeActStudio/WeActStudio.WCH-BLE-Core">WeAct Studio BLE Core Board</a>.</p>
<h3 id="its-not-used-in-many-designs">It’s Not Used in Many Designs</h3>
<p>My interest in the board comes from my interest in custom mechanical keyboard designs.<br />
– The best part of ‘free and open source’ is the “gratis” part.<br />
But the “libre” part is neat, too: it’s much easier to realize an interesting keyboard design if all you need to do is iterate on a keyboard design someone else has made.</p>
<p>I’ve never tried designing a Bluetooth keyboard.<br />
The sour grapes explanation is that Bluetooth devices are finicky to use. (Which is true).<br />
What most hobbyists do for Bluetooth keyboards is use Bluetooth-powered devboards like the nice!nano, and use ZMK firmware. – TBH part of why I’m not interested in this devboard is it costs over 20 USD. (And it’s most common in split keyboards, which’d need one for each side!).</p>
<p>I recently picked up a WeAct Studio BLE Core board, ordered from AliExpress.<br />
(I’ve used a few different devboards from WeAct Studio in several of my keyboard PCB designs; including WCH MCUs).<br />
The BLE core board has designs for the different MCUs: CH573, CH582, CH592.<br />
In contrast, this devboard costs $2.</p>
<p>But despite it being such a cheap board, I can’t find any designs which use this board.</p>
<p>Some notes on what I could find:</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/joric/nrfmicro/wiki/Alternatives#ch582">Alternatives wiki page on joric’s nrfmicro repo</a>
describes the CH582 as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>QMK has a CH582 port! It has BLE and there’s a dev board for it on Aliexpress for about 2 bucks. That is, if you’re willing to experiment since, as far as I’m aware, no keyboard has been designed with it and there’s not a lot of users yet. [ZMK not supported.]
… Last I looked, datasheets were basically “sorry, not documented” on the registers for BLE hardware. And 32KB of RAM on the CH582F would definitely be a challenge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regarding “low RAM an issue” semickolon (who authored FAK firmware for the CH552 MCU) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/comments/18aekwm/comment/kbz35tc/">commented that the chip’s BLE only uses 4KB RAM, and that FAK had about 1KB RAM</a>. (He also mentions he’s got a keyboard working with some firmware he’s building for the chips).</p>
<p>The datasheets indeed omit documentation for the registers for the BLE hardware.</p>
<p>FWIW, I did see some BLE keyboards using these WCH chips on OSHWHub such as <a href="https://oshwhub.com/cansong/ch579_keyboard_v0-1">cansong’s ch579 keyboard</a>, which points to <a href="https://oshwhub.com/JokerAlon/ch579m-64keyboard">JokerAlon’s ch579m</a>. Albeit, the readmes for these aren’t in English. – The schematics are available, at least.</p>
<p>Albeit, at the time of writing, there really aren’t many English search engine results for CH592. Nor CH58x. Nor CH57x.<br />
The keyboards above seem to be row-stagger, and with big spacebars. (The big spacebars make it easier to design a PCB, but don’t make for a good keyboard. – I do recall seeing boardsource.xyz’s solution to this for their <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/t1c5pl/technikable_gb_is_live_on_boardsourcexyz_wireless/">technikable ble ortho</a> was to omit the 2 keys in the bottom corners of each side..).</p>
<p>I wasn’t aware of it before, but both the wiki page above (and the reddit comment) point to <a href="https://github.com/O-H-M2/qmk_port_ch582">O-H-M2’s port of QMK for CH582</a>. (Looking at the port a bit: it retains upstream QMK’s codebase unchanged, and adds some platform-specific code for CH582).<br />
(There are keyboards listed in this; one seems to be a giant handwired ortho, the others are either macropads/numpads, or row-staggered with big spacebars).<br />
The default branch name is <code>via</code>; the readme mentions via functionality is implemented. (I don’t use via/vial, but seems it’s useful for many).</p>
<p>On GitHub, <a href="https://github.com/openwch/ch592">OpenWCH provides EVTs with Examples and SDKs for CH592</a> (and other chips). (Whereas, <a href="https://github.com/SoCXin/CH552.git">CH552 is in the SoCXin org</a>). – These examples include a BLE HID “keyboard” (it periodically sends a HID keyboard report, but doesn’t read GPIO pins).<br />
– So, there is working code, and a README PDF(!) describing how to run the example.. this PDF describes to use <a href="http://www.mounriver.com/download">MounRiver Studio</a>.</p>
<p>Using MounRiver Studio works (at least for building these EVT Examples; I didn’t try flashing from MounRiver).</p>
<p>I saw that the <a href="https://github.com/WeActStudio/WeActStudio.WCH-BLE-Core">WeAct BLE repo</a> included <code>Makefile</code>s for its code (copied from the EVT).<br />
Copy-pasting the comment at the header of the file into a translate service: “generated, do not modify”.<br />
Oh no.</p>
<p>That’s … not a promising sign.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the <a href="https://github.com/O-H-M2/qmk_port_ch582/blob/via/README.md#developers">QMK port to CH582’s readme</a> has instructions which mention downloading the MounRiver Studio toolchain and using <code>cmake</code>/<code>make</code>.</p>
<h2 id="toolchain-building-the-ch582-port-of-qmk">Toolchain: Building the CH582 Port of QMK</h2>
<p>I’m running NixOS, and one of the downsides of using NixOS is it can be difficult to run binaries distributed in tarballs.</p>
<p>MounRiver Studio and its toolchain is distributed as binaries in a tarball.</p>
<p>I was able to come up with some Nix packages for the <code>libmcuupdate.so</code> distributed in the toolchain tarball, and the GCC toolchain:<br />
https://github.com/O-H-M2/qmk_port_ch582/commit/40828b8361bbc711fb7c7af00374eea565f75d2f<br />
(I <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/54aac082a4d9bb5bbc5c4e899603abfb76a3f6d6/pkgs/development/compilers/gcc-arm-embedded/12/default.nix">adapted another Nix package which downloads GCC in a tarball</a>).</p>
<p>With that, I was able to build the QMK port for CH582 built.</p>
<p>Oh. Wait. Taking a look at the <code>--version</code> for the toolchain MounRiver Studio distributes:</p>
<pre><code>$ riscv-none-embed-gcc --version
riscv-none-embed-gcc (xPack GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC, 64-bit) 8.2.0
Copyright (C) 2018 Free Software Foundation, Inc.</code></pre>
<h2 id="risc-v-toolchain">Risc-V Toolchain</h2>
<p>Links to things:</p>
<p>The old <a href="https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack">riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/sifive/riscv-gcc">SiFive’s riscv-gcc</a>.</p>
<p>And the newer <a href="https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-elf-gcc-xpack">riscv-none-elf-gcc-xpack</a>.
And this seems related:
https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain.</p>
<p>The change from <code>riscv-none-embed-gcc</code> to <code>riscv-none-elf-gcc</code> is mentioned in the <a href="https://xpack.github.io/blog/2022/05/14/riscv-none-elf-gcc-v11-3-0-1-released/">xPack riscv gcc 11.3 release notes</a>.</p>
<p>Trying these upstream xpack riscv toolchains with the qmk port for ch582.. for one, <code>TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX</code> needs to be set to <code>risc-none-embed</code> if using the older GCCs. But, I did need to make a couple of other changes:</p>
<p>The MounRiver toolchain has an extra param <code>highcode-gen-section-name</code> that the xpack toolchains don’t have:
https://github.com/O-H-M2/qmk_port_ch582/commit/347e15458be15a714494d0088fa77243f62e7009</p>
<p>And, as the <a href="https://xpack.github.io/blog/2022/05/15/riscv-none-elf-gcc-v12-1-0-1-released/#risc-v-isa-updates">xPack riscv gcc 12.1 release notes explain</a>, errors like <code>extension</code>zicsr’ required<code>can be fixed by adding</code>_zicsr` to the arch: https://github.com/O-H-M2/qmk_port_ch582/commit/dafb73132b6642ac70322239673060fe56d0b9b9</p>
<p>(I didn’t try <a href="https://github.com/O-H-M2/qmk_port_ch582/tree/2dde4b4777d2e91abe0b96c91b64f3fea5cd7ecb/utils">the toolchain that’s checked into the git repo</a>; but seeing stuff like that makes me wonder if the embedded developers are doing okay).</p>
<h2 id="building-the-examples-outside-mounriver-studio">Building the Examples Outside MounRiver Studio</h2>
<p>The EVT Examples are supplied with only a MounRiver Studio project file.</p>
<p>Since I’m not sure what works and what doesn’t work (in terms of how to compile the examples outside of MounRiver), it’s easiest to start from something that works. – Building it in MounRiver works, which generates some Makefiles.</p>
<p>Using that, I adapted a Makefile with the same compiler flags to get a Makefile which produced a working build.<br />
(Or, honestly: I’d copied the makefile from the broadcaster example, but that set different <code>-D</code> defines, which didn’t play nicely with the BLE HID example, and it took me some time to notice why my Makefile wasn’t producing a working build of the example).</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>I copied the BLE HID_Example example, put it together with a standalone Makefile, and some Nix files to provide the toolchain, and shared it in this repo: https://github.com/rgoulter/ch592-ble-hid-keyboard-example</p>
<h2 id="flashing-the-firmware">Flashing the Firmware</h2>
<p>Flashing the CH592 is the same as flashing the CH552. You can enter the bootloader by holding the BOOT button when plugging the board into the computer, and then use <a href="https://github.com/ch32-rs/wchisp">ch32-rs’ wchisp</a> to flash the firmware. (On Windows, I’d had difficulty using <code>wchisp</code>; but the official programs from WCH worked on Windows when I tried with the CH552).</p>
