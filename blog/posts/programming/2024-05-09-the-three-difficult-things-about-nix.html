<p><a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a> is a fancy package manager, with a bunch of powerful features.</p>
<p>One thing it’s notorious for is its steep learning curve.</p>
<p>Although generally, learning to write Nix code is difficult for the same reasons a lot of other tech is difficult (e.g. you have to be aware of what’s possible, and unfamiliar things are always going to be have friction compared to what’s familiar), I reckon there are a bit more specifically three reasons why Nix is difficult.</p>
<p>Any difficulty someone is having when trying to use Nix almost always falls into one of:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>difficulty with the Nix package manager itself.</p></li>
<li><p>difficulty with the Nixpkgs codebase.</p></li>
<li><p>difficulty with software and how it mixes with Nix’s approach.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Discussing this a bit more:</p>
<h2 id="three-difficulties">Three Difficulties</h2>
<h3 id="difficulty-with-the-nix-package-manager-itself">Difficulty with the Nix Package Manager Itself</h3>
<p>When learning about Docker, you’ll need to learn about the difference between an “image” and a “container”.</p>
<p>Or when learning Terraform, you need to build an intuition for how the providers model and manipulate the resources being declared.</p>
<p>With the Nix package manager, there are also a bunch of concepts to learn.</p>
<p>Nix’s approach to package management is quite different to how traditional package managers have done things. So, with Nix, you end up bumping into weird terms like “derivation”, “instantiate”, “realise”.</p>
<p>I disagree with many who say things like “I like the idea of Nix, but wish I could write it in JavaScript”. The Nix expression language is <em>essentially</em> a “JSON + function (+ imports)”, similar to languages like Jsonnet (which I don’t hear the same complaints about).<br />
But, I agree it’s fair to say that the Nix expression language’s laziness can lead to code that’s very “clever” (and hard to read). And concepts like “partially applying a function” are common in functional programming, and unusual/exotic otherwise.<br />
And e.g. it took me some time to wrap my head around why many Nix files would open with <code>{ pkgs ? import &lt;nixpkgs&gt; {} }:</code>.</p>
<p>Much of the community has adopted use of Nix Flakes.<br />
There are several things about flakes that are not very ergonomic, and not all that intuitive, although overall I think they’re not too difficult to understand, and using flakes comes with more benefits than disadvantages.</p>
<h3 id="difficulty-with-the-nixpkgs-codebase">Difficulty with the Nixpkgs Codebase</h3>
<p>Nixpkgs is somewhat comparable to the “standard library” of Nix.</p>
<p>A lot of Nix code will typically use common functions in nixpkgs. e.g. functions like <code>pkgs.mkShell</code> or <code>buildPythonPackage</code> <a href="https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Python">on the NixOS wiki page for Python</a> are a part of the nixpkgs codebase.</p>
<p>Nixpkgs is a large codebase. It’s not immediately clear what’s useful and available. As you dive deeper into Nixpkgs, you quickly see it’s filled with a mixture of similar-but-different and often “clever” solutions to similar problems.</p>
<p>I think this is responsible for a lot of difficulty with <em>writing</em> Nix code. (Although I think e.g. <a href="https://nix.dev/">nix.dev</a> now does a lot to ease over the rough edges of getting started).</p>
<p>If you provided <code>pkgs.mkShell</code> in JavaScript, it would still be confusing to use.</p>
<p>It can be difficult to figure out how to properly access and manipulate code in nixpkgs.</p>
<p>The <code>lib.customisation</code> <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#sec-functions-library-customisation">lib functions</a> are both confusing to understand and related to <code>.override</code> and <code>.callPackage</code> functions which are extremely common when dealing with Nix packages.</p>
<h3 id="difficulty-with-software-and-how-it-mixes-with-nixs-approach">Difficulty with Software and How it Mixes with Nix’s Approach</h3>
<p>This sorta applies more to NixOS than to Nix. (If someone runs into problems with Nix on non-NixOS, they can always just do things without touching Nix).</p>
<p>One of the reasons Nix is difficult is that when something goes wrong, it often requires a deeper and broader understanding of what’s going, compared to other Linux systems. – You might need to understand what nix is doing, what the nixpkgs code in use is doing, or what the system-under-nix is doing.</p>
<p>As a novice programmer, I could get by with copying and pasting snippets from StackOverflow (after searching for whatever error message I encountered). – Not so if you run into problems when on NixOS!</p>
<p>Nix doesn’t <em>replace</em> other Linux things (like <code>make</code>), so much as it uses them in an uncommon way. – I recall reading a comment where someone’s cold shower against Nix hype was that it was “just” using <code>make</code> &amp; symlinks. – Nix and NixOS mean an additional layer that may need to be understood.</p>
<p>Probably the most common example of this problem is that it’s difficult to run pre-built binaries on NixOS, unlike on most other Linux distributions. On other Linux systems, shared libraries get installed into a global location, and pre-built binaries are able to find these. Whereas NixOS puts shared libraries in isolated locations, so pre-built binaries don’t run without some massaging.</p>
<p>It can be extra frustrating that something is easy on other Linux distributions but may be difficult with Nix/NixOS.</p>
<h2 id="other-remarks">Other Remarks</h2>
<p>There are sometimes difficulties people run into with Nix that don’t really fit into these categories. e.g. sometimes a tool takes an approach which doesn’t map well to how Nix wants things done. But, if someone has the above difficulties covered (they’ve got a good understanding of Nix, the relevant parts of Nixpkgs, and of what the program is doing), then the problem is more likely to feel tractable.</p>
<p>Another way of putting the above difficulties is “you gotta know what you’re doing (if something goes wrong)”.<br />
And for many developers, there’s an expectation of being able to get pretty far without needing to spend a long time learning all the details. (Often this is a pretty good strategy!).</p>
<p>I think to some extent, some of that difficulty is fundamental.<br />
Nix provides benefits like “will work the same way next time you run it”, and this demands it comes with a level of strictness.</p>
