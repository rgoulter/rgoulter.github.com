<p>Recently I’ve had the motivation to try and maintain one of my side-projects.<br />
Or at least, brush it up from being “completely awful” to “not terrible”.</p>
<p>This is mostly just for fun.<br />
But in a way, it’s valuable in that I learn the lessons of what it’s like to
maintain a project which isn’t freshly-written. That’s the kindof learning which
fresh programmers can’t easily get.</p>
<p>Partly this also comes from wanting to be able to display a ‘portfolio’ of
‘look, I can program’.<br />
Albeit, it’s hard to justify it from this perspective, since:
- The <a href="http://www.daedtech.com/hiring-is-broken/">original post mentioned here</a>
essentially says “I had a great personal brand, but didn’t get hired anyway”.
- On the one hand, this is great in terms of ‘equal opportunity’, in that
what supposedly matters is ‘ability to pass a tech interview’, not
‘ability to present yourself well’. And <em>in theory</em> the former ought to be
better than the latter at predicting ‘will do a good job’.
- I saw a post on LinkedIn where a guy pointed out that, although he had applied
via LinkedIn to over 900 job listings, the only times he got a job was through
networking.
- On the other hand, this is concerning in terms of ‘equal opportunity’, in
that effects of networking aren’t going to be as fair as a more ‘systematic’
process of finding a candidate. (Or so you’d think!).</p>
<p>So. While I think it makes sense that ‘polished side project’ means ‘good
portfolio’ and a step towards ‘good personal brand’; it seems like tech doesn’t
particularly respect ‘good personal brand’.<br />
So, side projects are just for fun. :-)</p>
<h2 id="things-i-didnt-dounderstand-in-c-as-an-undergraduate">Things I Didn’t Do/Understand in C++ as an Undergraduate</h2>
<h3 id="properly-setting-up-the-windows-build">Properly Setting Up the Windows Build</h3>
<p>The project is an old C++ project which was initially done for a computational
geometry course. Generally, as an undergraduate, the process for such projects
is “here’s how to manually install any dependency, here’s how to configure the
project”.</p>
<p>My experience of not-C++ projects is “here’s the project dependencies file,
and here’s the command to install the dependencies”.<br />
I don’t know which language did this first, but this is my experience with
e.g. Ruby, Python, Haskell, even Java/Scala.</p>
<p>This recent iteration of maintaining the side-project was aimed at getting the
project to work on Windows. Previous refactoring efforts (e.g. to use CMake,
adding a <code>.travis.yml</code> file to the repository) improved the project for
Linux/macOS, but broke the Windows build.<br />
Joy.</p>
<p>I ran into a couple of problems getting the project working on Windows.<br />
One was getting the compiler to find the dependencies. (On Linux, this is
more/less a process of “use system package manager to install dependencies).<br />
The other was that, I’d refactored the code to use a class called”Polygon”,
and one of my files included <code>&lt;windows.h&gt;</code>, which has a function called
<code>Polygon</code> which pollutes the global namespace and etc.<br />
Fun to figure out.</p>
<p>Windows C++ development is made a bit more confusing in that there are different
compilers / environments. e.g. MSYS2/MinGW, and MSVC (Visual Studio’s C/C++
compiler).<br />
– It took me way too long to figure out fundamental things about these. In the
end, I figured out the easiest thing to do was write a <code>.bat</code> script which adds
the relevant compiler to <code>PATH</code>.</p>
<p>As an example of how ‘weird’ this is, CMake’s “MinGW Makefiles” didn’t work if
MSYS2’s <code>sh.exe</code> was on <code>PATH</code>. With <code>MSYS2</code> and <code>MinGW</code> on the <code>PATH</code>, the
correct generator to use would be <code>MSYS Makefiles</code>.</p>
<h3 id="getting-the-thing-to-run-maybe-deploy">Getting the Thing to Run (&amp; Maybe Deploy)</h3>
<p>My experience with programming in other languages:<br />
If you can build the project, you can run the project.<br />
My experience with C++:<br />
Just because the project built, doesn’t mean that the project would run.</p>
<p>The reason for this is fairly straightforward: C++ builds the executable,
and the dependencies in other libraries will get ‘linked’ dynamically when the
program runs. (On Windows, from Dynamically-Linked Libraries. On unix, from
shared libraries). And so these need to be on the <code>PATH</code> when running the
program. But not when building the program.<br />
– Perhaps you’ll forgive me if this wasn’t immediately obvious to me (given the
‘can build the thing =&gt; can run the thing’ expectation).</p>
<p>I’m aware that one way to get around this is to ‘statically link’ the
dependencies into the built executable.<br />
– But I’m not aware of a trivial/easy way to do this on Windows. (Especially
not if there’re complicated transitive dependencies!).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I’m <em>still</em> not aware of an easy way to <em>find</em> all these
requisite DLLs for running the executable.<br />
– It occurs to me that for “other languages”, I never really dealt with “how to
deploy the program; how to share it with someone else”. This is one BIG
advantage to JavaScript / web browser programs. (Or web applications).</p>
<h3 id="vcpkg-is-great">VCPKG is Great</h3>
<p>I am vaguely aware that conan.io is one piece of software trying to bring the
concept of ‘modern language dependency installer’ to C++.</p>
<p>I saw that an example of competing software is vcpkg.<br />
I tried it, it’s <em>amazing</em>.</p>
<p>It’s only for the Visual Studio compiler, and is analogous to pacman for MSYS2’s
MinGW-w64 compiler.</p>
<p>It Just Works.<br />
– You use it to install certain packages (e.g. OpenCV, Qt5) and it downloads
the source, builds the project.</p>
<p>When using vcpkg to build a project, it copies the DLLs to the build directory
which makes the program easier to deploy/share. Whoa!</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, static-linking with vcpkg would be easy, too, since
vcpkg builds the packages from source.</p>
<p>One downside is that not all projects support all generators. (e.g. I couldn’t
use ninja with OpenCV on Windows for MSVC. But this is upstream, and not vcpkg’s
fault).</p>
<p>Compared to conan.io?<br />
The vcpkg FAQ argues that vcpkg targets only Windows/MSVC, so doesn’t
have to solve the problems which conan.io is trying to solve (and which are
solved by distribution package managers like brew, pacman).<br />
And that since vcpkgs is a privately-maintained repository of packages, rather
than a ‘public federation’ of packages, there’s less effort required to find the
dependencies which work for your project.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-appveyor">Setting Up AppVeyor</h3>
<p>One of the cool things about open-source projects these days is the fancy badges
they have saying “hey the project is working”.</p>
<p>Travis-CI is one such CI service which offers free builds for “open source”
projects. (i.e. free stuff for public repositories).<br />
But Travis-CI only supports Linux/macOS. The equivalent for Windows is AppVeyor.</p>
<p>Despite my newfound knowledge of how to build the project reliably on Windows,
I found this not-so-easy.</p>
<p>Using vcpkg for the build is a nice idea. But vcpkg doesn’t use binaries for
its packages. So although vcpkg makes it super easy to get a development
environment going, … it takes too long for an AppVeyor build, if using
sufficiently heavy dependencies. (AppVeyor builds time out after an hour).</p>
<p>Fortunately, the machine does have common heavy dependencies like Qt5 installed
already.<br />
But it didn’t have OpenCV.</p>
<p>It may be that using chocolatey (Windows’ answer to macOS’ homebrew) to install
OpenCV is probably ‘best’.<br />
But I wanted to keep with vcpkg.</p>
<p>The main difficult I had was to cache the vcpkg directory. It took me some
time to realise that I was the caching didn’t affect the <code>init</code> section of the
AppVeyor build. (i.e. the cache only gets loaded for the <code>build</code> step, and
cache gets saved after the <code>build</code> step).<br />
Oops.</p>
<h3 id="thoughts-on-the-c-language">Thoughts on the C++ Language</h3>
<p>The above remarks (e.g. about not knowing how to find DLLs, &amp; that it’s hard
to install dependencies) are more about the environment C++ runs in, and the
developer ecosystem.<br />
But considering C++ as a language:</p>
<p>Okay to be fair, I don’t think anyone really defends C++ as a “good” language
(aside from maybe the pragmatic case that “it’s what people use”, and that
having an imperfect which works is better than not having anything, etc.).</p>
<p>C++ is monstrously complex. (e.g. a C++ parser is something which has to be
hand-written, since the language is so complex). “Effective C++” describes C++
as a ‘federation of four languages’. (If I recall correctly: C, C with classes,
standard-template library, and template meta-programming).<br />
– There are competing languages for “better C” replacement: Go, Rust, and then
more obscure languages like D (which I’ve heard is really nice, but seems to
lack the community which e.g. Rust has gunned for).</p>
<p>What I’ve come to realise maintaining this C++ project is that there’s a lot of
C++ stuff which I’d consider ‘fundamental’ in other languages, where with C++
“I just don’t know it”.<br />
And I don’t think other languages suffer this problem as easily.</p>
<p>The details sound fairly easy, but it’s not necessarily clear how they combine.<br />
For example: individually the words <code>const</code>, <code>pointer</code>, <code>reference</code> are individually
easy to understand, but very quickly difficult to understand when combined.<br />
<em>Especially</em> for someone who hasn’t maintained a C++ project in a long time.</p>
<p>e.g. Coming from other languages, it may not be clear that there’s a difference
between ‘direct initialization’ and ‘copy initialization’. cf. <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/initialization">CPP
Reference</a>.</p>
<p>Every language inevitably has a ‘long tail’ of obscure details that an
experienced programmer will run into. I don’t even know what kindof weird stuff
that’d involve for C++!<br />
But with C++, I feel it’s more like the ‘lowest common denominator’ of being
able to write simple C++ programs (e.g. “Undergrad C++”) doesn’t cover very much.</p>
<h2 id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding Thoughts</h2>
<p>One way to summarize the above is I’ve gone from ‘I wrote a project in C++ while
not knowing much about C++’ to ‘I had to learn a bit more about how C++ stuff
works for polishing the project’.<br />
– I kindof have mixed thoughts about these things. It’s .. nice that with
programming, it’s ‘easy’ to do a lot of cool stuff without having a good
understanding of what’s really going on.<br />
But it also seems a bit uncraftsmanlike to make stuff with such a poor
understanding.</p>
<p>I think polishing this side-project a bit has been a good project for
understanding what to avoid in a project, and what’s good to have.</p>
