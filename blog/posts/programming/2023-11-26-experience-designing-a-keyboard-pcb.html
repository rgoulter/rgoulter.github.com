<p>I designed a <a href="https://github.com/rgoulter/keyboard-labs/releases/tag/ch552_48-rev2023.1">keyboard PCB</a>, which I’m calling “CH552-48”. (It uses the CH552 MCU, and it has 48 keys).</p>
<p>This was
I have designed <a href="https://github.com/rgoulter/keyboard-labs#keyboards">other keyboard PCBs</a>,
but I’m particularly pleased with this one.<br />
The keyboard PCBs I’ve designed fall into two kinds: those that use a development board (and are relatively easy to solder by hand), and those that are intended to be manufactured with “PCBA”.<br />
However, the devboard-based designs were pretty easy to design; and while I found the PyKey40 tricky to design (I found it quite tricky to fit the MCU between the keyboard switches; an ortholinear keyboard doesn’t allow for much space!), I was more/less modifying an existing PCB design.</p>
<p>To be honest.. the keyboard PCB designs I’ve done aren’t really aiming for “great keyboard” so much as they’re aiming for “interesting PCB to design”.<br />
e.g. designing a split keyboard where each half is smaller than 10x10cm may not make for a ‘great’ keyboard, but the design constraint made it really fun to design.<br />
The “X-2 Lumberjack Arm” is a pretty good keyboard. I think it’s visually very striking. At the time I designed it, there weren’t many Arm-powered (ortholinear) keyboards that could be bought off-the-shelf.<br />
And PyKey40 is also a good keyboard.. but, I had thought it’d be an interesting challenge to try and cram the fully-featured PyKey60 into the smaller 4x12 grid.<br />
– I do like that idea “first time you do something, it’s as a scientist; the second time, as an engineer, but by the third time it’s as a technician”.</p>
<p>I wanted to design the CH552-48 after I came across the <a href="https://github.com/semickolon/fak">fak firmware</a>. Fak firmware was written for the CH552, which has the advantage of being much cheaper than the RP2040 (even if it’s not as powerful).</p>
<p>Something that made this an interesting or constrained PCB to design was that the CH552T MCU only has 14 GPIO pins.<br />
A keyboard uses the GPIO pins for scanning which keys have been pressed. Typically, 1 pin is used for each row and each column of the keyboard matrix. e.g. a 60-key keyboard arranged in 5 rows of 12 columns would typically use 17 pins.<br />
I have seen other projects use the CH552 for keyboards, but these tend to be keyboards with a very low number of keys, such as using it for a numpad, or using a CH552 for one half of a small split keyboard.<br />
I figured that 14 pins allows for 7 rows of 7 columns, or about 49 keys.</p>
<p>Obviously, a square keyboard wouldn’t make for a useful desktop computer keyboard.. but instead, the 7x7 matrix could be the ‘logical’ matrix, and I could arrange the 48 keys in 4 rows of 12 columns. I thought this was pretty neat.</p>
<p>I designed the <a href="https://github.com/rgoulter/keyboard-labs/releases/tag/ch552_44-rev2023.1">CH552-44</a> first, which more/less takes the same shape as the <a href="https://github.com/rgoulter/keyboard-labs/releases/tag/pico42-rev2023.1">Pico42 keyboard</a> which I had designed earlier as a workaround to make use of keyboard cases I borked the design for. (The Pico42 in turn does itself bear close resemblance to the <a href="https://github.com/rgoulter/keyboard-labs#x-2-5x12-ortholinear-arm-powered-adaptation-of-peejs-lumberjack-pcb">X-2 “Lumberjack Arm”</a> keyboard I’d designed earlier..).</p>
<p>It made sense to start with CH552-44 as a proof-of-concept since it would be solderable with only through-hole components, which are <em>very</em> easy to solder.</p>
<p>In designing the CH552-44, I had to come up with some scheme to actually route this logical 7x7 matrix laid out on a physical 4x12 grid.<br />
When the logical matrix is the same size as the physical matrix, it’s straightforward to connect each of the column pins together.<br />
But with a mismatch between the logical matrix and the physical matrix, some complexity was inevitable.</p>
<p>Keyboard designs, especially ortholinear keyboard designs, involve a lot of patterns and repetition.
My experience is that early on when routing the traces for the PCB, it might not be clear what the patterns for the traces <em>should</em> be; but once it does become clear, then routing the traces does become straightforward.</p>
<p>This part of PCB design can be very fun. – In a way, it tickles the same part of the brain that some parts of Factorio do: in Factorio, you need to connect certain outputs to certain inputs, and the challenge is in how to physically arrange the systems as part of a larger factory; ideally in an organised manner, without too much spaghetti. Hobbyist PCB design is exactly the same.</p>
<p>Compare the traces for the Pico42:</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rgoulter/keyboard-labs/master/docs/images/keyboards/pico42/keyboard-pico42-2023.2-bottom.svg" width="600" /></p>
<p>with those of the CH552-44:</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rgoulter/keyboard-labs/master/docs/images/keyboards/ch552-44/keyboard-ch552-44-2023.1a-bottom.svg" width="600" /></p>
<p>It’s not an <em>extreme</em> difference, but the CH552-44 does feel like it’s got busier streets and city blocks.</p>
<p>Anyway. Once I’d received these CH552-44 PCBs, and checked that they worked with the CH552 devboard I was using, the next step I wanted to try was to make a PCBA version of the design.</p>
<p>This itself wasn’t too hard, either.</p>
<p>I looked at the devboard’s schematic, saw what parts of that I was using, and replaced the devboard in my schematic with those parts.</p>
<p>Overall, not too much needed to be changed for the PCBA design:</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rgoulter/keyboard-labs/master/docs/images/keyboards/ch552-48/keyboard-ch552-48-2023.1-bottom.svg" width="600" /></p>
<p>I haven’t done much with PCBA.<br />
I found JLCPCB’s most accessible; since you can search what components they have, and they provide some documentation for the files you need to give them so they can assemble the keyboard for you.<br />
(Whereas, for other places, you have to send them the components?).</p>
<p>But, since this PCBA project was similar enough to the PCBA project I had done before, it wasn’t too much effort to figure out how to set this part up.</p>
<p>The main effort was figuring out how to reduce the PCBA costs. Some of the components that JLCPCB uses are “basic parts”, some are “extended parts”, and it costs a few dollars extra for each “extended part” you use. – So, the goal is to find and use the “basic parts” when you can.</p>
<p>I wasn’t 100% sure that the PCBA design would work. So, it was a relief to find that it worked without issue.</p>
<p>And with the CH552 being a low-budget MCU, the cost to get it manufactured was relatively low.</p>
<p>Overall, it might be that no particular step of this was far beyond my experience. But, it was a satisfying use of the PCB designing I’d been doing before, with a PCB design that had some interesting constraints.</p>
