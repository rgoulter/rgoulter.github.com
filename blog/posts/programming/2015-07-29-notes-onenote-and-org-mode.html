<p>Many programmers who maintain a blog, I believe, use it as a kind of note-keeping place. Programmer-y stuff can be hard; it’s easy to forget what steps to take when building some program on some distribution – especially what difficulties come up, how to overcome them.<br />
– I’ve used my blog for that.</p>
<p>I’ve also kept a programming journal.<br />
I’m not sure how common this is; I’ve never met anyone who’s done the same. One of the techniques I used was, perhaps in a similar vein to de Bono’s Thinking Hats, making use of colour: red was for things which went wrong (e.g. compiler errors which I didn’t know how to fix), green was for questions (e.g. how does X work? why is it doing that?), blue for facts, black for thoughts, purple for new ideas. – That is, when making notes, it’s useful to distinguish different kinds of thoughts.</p>
<p>When working on my Bachelor of Computing Dissertation, my Final Year Project (FYP), I also made use of Microsoft’s OneNote, in tandem with this journal-writing.<br />
– During my FYP, there were several aspects to the project which would be fun to explore at the start (e.g. how to write Eclipse plugins, inter-process communication between different programs using e.g. Apache Thrift, BNFs of the C grammar, diagrams of ASTs of various C declarations, etc.). - For this, I did prefer to write with pen &amp; paper: I’ve got a decently sized 5-partition folder filled with my notes for these (&amp; relevant print-outs).<br />
OneNote was damn useful for maintaining a series of project-related links. Early on in my FYP I was trying to compile CERN’s Cling (a C++ interpreter) on Windows. I never had any success; but OneNote was invaluable in keeping notes like the output of commands, comments from similar efforts, etc.</p>
<p>From my use and experience, being “searchable” wasn’t such a big deal. (<em>I</em> knew roughly where what I was looking for would be.). This is mitigated by OneNote’s hierarchy UX:<br />
– What I like about OneNote, in lieu of my technique with ‘colours’ to shape thought, is that OneNote naturally shapes thought into hierarchies: a notebook has sections; sections have pages; a page is where you write, either with paragraphs, or with bullet points: it’s really, really easy to make (and remove) bullet points. (typing “*” is enough for OneNote to say “hey, this is a bullet point”.).<br />
Of course, being able to paste links in is useful. And there’re icons you can (quite easily) embellish bulletpoints with (like “Important!” icon, etc.).</p>
<p>Emacs’s Org mode is … not software I’ve used.<br />
It’s “life changing” for those who do make use of it. (Apparently it’s also a nice gateway drug to Emacs. Though key aspects of Org mode exist in Vim plugins, so there’s that.).<br />
– A key philosophy behind Org mode is the idea that ‘notes’ &amp; ‘tasks’ are inter-dependent: when you note things, you’re likely to then come up with tasks; and when you manage tasks, you’re likely to note things down.<br />
At-a-glance, it looks like Emacs’ Org mode has a bunch of fancy .. interfaces, views of data: this data, written in a plain textfile, appears it’s somewhat similar to OneNote: an Org file has headings (and sub-headings, and sub-sub-..), within a heading can have the paragraphs, bullet points, etc.; each heading can have meta-data associated with it (which is where “tasks” come into it), in terms of “TODO/DONE”, custom tags, deadlines, priority, or custom properties.<br />
– There’s supposedly other fancy tosh like export-to-PDF. That I can’t say I care for.</p>
<p>A key advantage to Org mode (in native Emacs, or whether in one of the Vim ports) would be ‘lightweight’-ness compared to OneNote. (You <em>can</em> make use of OneNote on Linux, but that’d have to be by opening a web browser. Thus, internet connection required..).<br />
But I am wondering how well Org mode’s ease-of-use, in terms of inputting bullet points/etc., compares to OneNote.<br />
I’m also wondering whether, in lay usage, the fancy different-perspectives/searching really make that much of a difference.</p>
