<p>For the last few months, I’ve been working on a new “smart keymap” library.</p>
<p>The code is published over at: <a href="https://github.com/rgoulter/smart-keymap" class="uri">https://github.com/rgoulter/smart-keymap</a>.</p>
<p>This post is to introduce this, go over what it is, and why I’ve found it
exciting to work on.</p>
<h1 id="smart-keymap">“Smart Keymap”</h1>
<p>By “smart keymap”, I mean the keymap behaviour for “smart keyboards”.</p>
<p>And by “smart keyboards”, I mean keyboards like those which run QMK or ZMK firmware.<br />
(I first saw the term used on the <a href="https://sites.google.com/alanreiser.com/handsdown">Hands Down
Layout</a> webpage).</p>
<p>Smart keyboards often provide functionality like “Layers” or “Tap-Hold” keys,
which allow the keys to have sophisticated behaviour.</p>
<p>For example, these features allow bringing the full functionality of the
keyboard to within easy reach of the hands resting on home row. (e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQUx2KtJ6TA">here’s a
video demonstrating how the miryoku layout does
this</a>).</p>
<h2 id="what-the-project-is">What the Project is</h2>
<p>The smart keymap library allows declaring a “smart keymap” which can be used as
part of a smart keyboard’s firmware.</p>
<p>The keymap is declared using <a href="https://nickel-lang.org/">the Nickel configuration
language</a>, a nifty “JSON + functions + types”
language.<br />
(If you’re familiar with the <a href="https://github.com/semickolon/fak">FAK keyboard
firmware</a>, you can understand the smart
keymap libary as like FAK, but targetting a broader set of MCUs than just the
CH55x).</p>
<h3 id="example-keymap">Example Keymap</h3>
<p>To illustrate, here’s an example keymap declared in Nickel for a 5x15
ortholinear keyboard:</p>
<pre class="nickel"><code>let K = import &quot;keys.ncl&quot; in

let DVORAK_  = 0 in

let ADJUST_  = RAISE_ + 2 in

{
  chords =
    let K = import &quot;keys.ncl&quot; in
    [
        { indices = [48, 49], key = K.LeftGUI &amp; K.PageUp, },
        { indices = [55, 56], key = K.LeftGUI &amp; K.PageDown, },
    ],

  config.tap_hold.interrupt_response = &quot;HoldOnKeyTap&quot;,

  custom_keys = fun K =&gt;
    let HoldLayerMod = fun layer_index =&gt; K.hold (K.layer_mod.hold layer_index) in
    {
      DVOR = K.layer_mod.set_default DVORAK_,
      GAME = K.layer_mod.set_default GAMING_,

      ENT_R = K.Return &amp; HoldLayerMod RAISE_,
      ESC_L = K.Escape &amp; HoldLayerMod LOWER_,
      ADJ   = K.layer_mod.hold ADJUST_,

      # Tap-Hold Home Row Modifiers
      A_A = K.A &amp; K.hold K.LeftAlt,
      G_O = K.O &amp; K.hold K.LeftGUI,
      C_E = K.E &amp; K.hold K.LeftCtrl,
      S_U = K.U &amp; K.hold K.LeftShift,

      S_H = K.H &amp; K.hold K.RightShift,
      C_T = K.T &amp; K.hold K.LeftCtrl,
      G_N = K.N &amp; K.hold K.RightGUI,
      A_S = K.S &amp; K.hold K.LeftAlt,

      # Sticky modifier keys
      SK_S = K.sticky K.LeftShift,
      SK_C = K.sticky K.LeftCtrl,
      SK_G = K.sticky K.LeftGUI,
      SK_A = K.sticky K.LeftAlt,
    },

<p>Using an expressive language like Nickel has some compelling advantages for
text-based or declarative keymap configuration, compared to what’s required
to write keymaps for other keyboard firmware.</p>
<p>e.g. QMK’s <a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/keymap">keymaps are written in C</a>, or a <code>keymap.json</code>
<a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/newbs_building_firmware_workflow#add-a-json-keymap">as downloaded from the online QMK
Configurator</a>.</p>
<p>e.g. <a href="https://zmk.dev/docs/config">ZMK uses kconfig and devicetree files for its
configuration</a>.</p>
<p>Using C to write keymaps allows for a breadth and depth of custom implementation
of behaviour.<br />
C is relatively simple. C &amp; CPP are somewhat limited and cumbersome when it comes
to making abstractions, such as re-using keymap functionality across keymaps.</p>
<p>Using a configuration language to define a keymap limits what the keymap can configure
to a smaller interface. But, Nickel’s highly expressive features allow it to construct
abstractions and reuse/customization more elegantly than CPP. – A Nickel keymap
configuration is going to be easier to maintain or re-use than code which makes heavy use
of CPP.</p>
<p>(Using Rust to write keymaps, as Keyberon does: it’s practically nicer to use
Rust than to make use of CPP; but, Rust’s strictness make it practically much more
difficult for Rust code to match how bespoke a keymap’s implementation can be.
Certainly in the case of QMK keymaps vs keyberon keymaps. – <a href="https://github.com/rgoulter/keyboard-labs/tree/master/firmware/keyberon/src/layouts">My own keymaps written in
Rust can be found here</a>).</p>
<h3 id="context-and-motivation-the-keymap-abstraction">Context and Motivation: The Keymap Abstraction</h3>
<p>From my experience <a href="https://github.com/rgoulter/keyboard-labs/tree/master/firmware/keyberon">writing firmware for different keyboards / MCUs with
keyberon</a>,
in order to best re-use code across those different firmware binaries, a fairly
natural pair of abstractions emerged: the first was abstracting over the logic
which produces input key press/release events from matrix scanning; the second,
abstracting over the mechanism which produces HID keyboard reports from those
key press/release events. – I’d describe the first as the “keyboard” or “keyboard
frontend”, the second as the “keymap” or “keyboard backend”.</p>
<p>Essentially, the smart keymap’s interface is along the lines of
<code>Keymap { handle_event(InputEvent); tick() -&gt; Output; }</code>.</p>
<p>Later, I made a prototype keyboard which used the CH58x MCU. The CH58x EVT
provides example firmware code, including an example HID keyboard, and a BLE
keyboard. – The keymap logic in these examples is essentially “in a loop, tap a
b c d …”. – That is, to make a practical keyboard firmware from the EVT
examples, you’d need to implement matrix scanning, and implement the keymap
behaviour. So, the same abstraction which was useful for code-reuse in writing keyberon
firmware would also be useful for writing keyboard firmware for the CH58x.</p>
<h3 id="keymap-not-keyboard">Keymap, not Keyboard</h3>
<p>The smart-keymap library’s scope is limited to “keymap functionality”, rather
than the broader scope of “keyboard functionality”.</p>
<p>This allows for the project to have a narrower focus on what it supports.</p>
<p>‘Keymap features’ are the behaviours from manipulating inputs; ‘keyboard features’
are related to physical parts of the keyboard.<br />
e.g. “tap hold key” functionality is definitely a keymap feature.<br />
Whereas e.g. “split keyboard” functionality is definitely a keyboard feature.
(The keymap behaviour would be the same whether the keyboard is split or not).<br />
For things like “change the RGB effect”, the keymap doesn’t need to know how the
RGB system is implemented. – All the keymap needs to provide is a way of invoking things
like “change the RGB effect”.</p>
<h3 id="library-not-framework">Library, not Framework</h3>
<p>Providing smart keymap functionality as a library also narrows the project’s
scope compared to writing an entire (keyboard) firmware framework.</p>
<p>Practically, I think it’s always going to be easier to bring up keyboard
firmware for some unsupported MCU by integrating a library into the an HID
keyboard example from an EVT, compared to the effort it’d take to adapt the EVT
into the platform-supporting code of a framework.</p>
<h1 id="why-this-has-been-exciting-to-write">Why This Has Been Exciting to Write</h1>
<h2 id="nickel-is-a-powerful-config-language">Nickel is a Powerful Config Language</h2>
<p>I first came across <a href="https://nickel-lang.org/">Nickel</a> in relation to
the <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix package manager</a>. – Nix is pretty neat;
so Nix-related things are likely to be neat.</p>
<p>Nickel, at a glance, is “JSON + functions (+ types)”.</p>
<p>The smart-keymap library obviously draws a lot of inspiration from
<a href="https://github.com/semickolon/fak">semickolon’s fak</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/semickolon/kirei">kirei</a> projects; both of which are keyboard
firmware which use Nickel for configuring the keymap.</p>
<p>My initial experience working with fak can be found in my
<a href="https://github.com/rgoulter/fak-config">fak-config</a>.</p>
<p>After having written much more Nickel code for smart-keymap,
a couple of things which stand out are its contracts,
and its modular configuration.</p>
<h3 id="nickel-contracts">Nickel Contracts</h3>
<p><a href="https://nickel-lang.org/user-manual/correctness/">The Nickel manual discusses how the language helps write ‘correct’
configurations</a>.</p>
<p>It took me some time to build an intuition for use of contracts.</p>
<p>Roughly, in Nickel, ‘types’ are only ever the concrete shape of the values.
e.g. Number, String, Array of type, Record of type. Types are checked
statically. Nickel doesn’t have user-defined types / aliases.</p>
<p>Whereas, contracts are a more expressive mechanism for describing more abstract
aspects of &amp; assertions about a value. Contracts are evaluated at runtime.
Contracts can be user defined; and can even be constructed from predicate or
validator functions on values.</p>
<h3 id="nickel-modular-configuration">Nickel Modular Configuration</h3>
<p><a href="https://nickel-lang.org/user-manual/modular-configurations/">The Nickel manual discusses how its record merging enables modular configuration</a>.</p>
<p>In the Nix ecosystem, several tools make use of modules. e.g. NixOS
configuration is done with modules, <a href="https://devenv.sh/">DevEnv</a> configuration
modules, <a href="https://flake.parts/">flake-parts</a> provides an interface for writing
flakes as modules.</p>
<p>Modules provide a way of writing code as composable elements.</p>
<p>Nickel’s records are evaluated lazily, &amp; can be combined, which allows Nickel
records to be used as modules.</p>
<p>In the smart-keymap codebase, the <a href="https://github.com/rgoulter/smart-keymap/tree/master/firmware/ch32x035-usb-device-compositekm-c/ncl/codegen">codegen for the CH32X
firmware</a>
is written in a modular style.<br />
e.g. <code>keyboard_split.ncl</code> is a module which describes what its inputs are, what
contracts it expects those inputs to satisfy, and its outputs.</p>
<p>How might that apply to keymaps?<br />
For example: a keymap might be defined using colemak by default, <code>{ alphas | default = colemak_dh, .. }</code>.
Nickel syntax would then allow re-using this keymap and changing <code>alphas</code> with <code>other_keymap &amp; { alphas = qwerty }</code>.</p>
<h2 id="inspirations-kirei-and-key-as-the-primary-keymap-abstraction">Inspirations: Kirei, and “Key as the primary keymap abstraction”</h2>
<p>Aside from using Nickel as the configuration language, and targeting the CH58x
MCU, smart-keymap also takes further inspiration from Kirei with its “key as the
primary keymap abstraction” idea.</p>
<p>Notice, it’s easy to consider generalisations of various smart keymap features.<br />
e.g. <a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/features/tri_layer">QMK’s tri-layer feature</a> can be
generalised as <a href="https://zmk.dev/docs/keymaps/conditional-layers">conditional
layers</a>, <a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/features/grave_esc">QMK’s
grave-esc</a> can be generalised as
<a href="https://zmk.dev/docs/keymaps/behaviors/mod-morph">mod-morph</a>. QMK’s
leader-sequences are kinda like its one-shot layers.</p>
<p>Or, generally: smart keymap functionality is about using different techniques to
modify what happens when a key is pressed &amp; released.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/comments/18wrt2i/the_layers_are_a_lie_kinda_rethinking_the/">You can even consider that “layers” fit into this
pattern</a>.</p>
<p>I thought this made for an interesting design spec: a keymap implementation
where “key behaviour” was the primary abstraction. (&amp; e.g. not “layers”).</p>
<p>Similarly, a neat observation kirei’s author made on the fak discord that a
smart keymap’s output (what keycodes get sent by a keymap, from a sequence of
key presses &amp; releases) resembles parsing a grammar. (What AST is constructed
from tokens for a grammar, from a sequence of input tokens).</p>
<h2 id="cheap-powerful-mcus-ch32x-ch58x">Cheap, Powerful MCUs: CH32X, CH58x</h2>
<p>One of the great things about the fak firmware is its support for low-cost MCUs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wch-ic.com/products/CH552.html">WCH’s CH552T</a> has an MCU in
TSSOP-20 for about $0.5, with 16KB flash, and about 1KB XRAM.</p>
<p>(For more GPIO / a larger package, the
<a href="https://www.wch-ic.com/products/CH559.html">CH559</a> has LQFP-48 for about $1.5,
with 60KB flash and 6KB XRAM).</p>
<p>Since smart-keymap is written in Rust, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html">it can run on targets that Rust
supports</a>.</p>
<p>In my case, I care about CH32X and CH58x:</p>
<h3 id="mcus-ch32x">MCUs: CH32X</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wch-ic.com/products/CH32X035.html">WCH’s CH32X</a> MCUs are about as
cheap as the CH552, but have a more powerful processor.</p>
<p>CH32X in the TSSOP-20 package costs around $0.45, its LQFP-48 package costs
0.75.<br />
The MCU has 62KB flash, 20KB SRAM.</p>
<p>The CH32X is just as simple to use in PCBs as the CH55x is.</p>
<p>The CH32X runs risc-v, and <a href="https://github.com/ch32-rs/ch32-hal/">can run Rust
firmware</a>.</p>
<h3 id="mcus-ch58x">MCUs: CH58X</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wch-ic.com/products/CH583.html">WCH’s CH58x</a> is notable for being
relatively a BLE-capable MCU that’s relatively cheap.</p>
<p>e.g. <a href="https://aliexpress.com/item/1005004784988010.html">WeAct Studio’s CH58x core
board</a> costs about $2.5.</p>
<p>It also <a href="https://github.com/ch32-rs/ch58x-hal/">can run Rust firmware</a>.</p>
<h1 id="whats-been-done-so-far">What’s Been Done So Far</h1>
<p>Quite a bit has been done! I’ve been using keyboards running smart-keymap-based
firmware for quite some time.</p>
<h2 id="smart-key-functionality">Smart Key functionality</h2>
<p><a href="https://rgoulter.com/smart-keymap/features.html">A broad set of features have been
implemented</a>.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the following have been implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>basic keyboard keys,</li>
<li>sticky modifier keys,</li>
<li>caps word,</li>
<li>tap hold keys,</li>
<li>tap dance keys,</li>
<li>layered keys,</li>
<li>chorded keys.</li>
</ul>
<p>The implementation for tap-hold has some support for configuration, such as
configuring the tap-hold resolution behaviour for key interrupts, or configuring
a required idle time before a tap-hold key can resolve as its hold key.</p>
<p>(Tap-hold was surprisingly difficult to implement!)</p>
<h2 id="example-firmware">Example Firmware</h2>
<p>I’ve written some basic firmware for some of the different keyboards I’ve made:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using Rust’s <a href="https://rtic.rs/1/book/en/">RTIC</a>, firmware for <a href="https://github.com/rgoulter/smart-keymap/tree/master/rp2040-rtic-smart-keyboard">the
RP2040</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/rgoulter/smart-keymap/tree/master/stm32f4-rtic-smart-keyboard">STM32F4</a>.</li>
<li>Using Rust’s <a href="https://embassy.dev">embassy</a>, firmware for
<a href="https://github.com/rgoulter/smart-keymap/tree/master/stm32-embassy-smart-keyboard">STM32</a>.</li>
<li>For the WCH MCUs, firmware which makes small changes to the HID keyboard
examples from the C EVT code, for
<a href="https://github.com/rgoulter/smart-keymap/tree/master/firmware/ch32x035-usb-device-compositekm-c">CH32X</a>
and for
<a href="https://github.com/rgoulter/smart-keymap/tree/master/firmware/ch58x-ble-hid-keyboard-c">CH58x</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Rust implementations cover examples of col-to-row and direct pins matrices,
as well as split keyboards (both full-duplex usart, and 1-wire half-duplex
usart).</p>
<h2 id="ch32x-pcbs">CH32X PCBs</h2>
<p>Previously, I had designed a couple of keyboards which used the CH552 and fak firmware.</p>
<p>The CH32X’s TSSOP-20 pinout isn’t compatible with CH552T, but porting a PCB from
using CH552T to CH32X is nevertheless straightforward.</p>
<p>I was able to port over
<a href="https://github.com/rgoulter/keyboard-labs#ch32x-36-low-budget-36-key-split-keyboard-with-smt-components">CH32X-36</a>,
and
<a href="https://github.com/rgoulter/keyboard-labs?tab=readme-ov-file#ch32x-48-low-budget-pcba-in-bm40jj40-form-factor">CH32X-48</a>,
as well as making use of the LQFP-48 CH32X to make the
<a href="https://github.com/rgoulter/keyboard-labs?tab=readme-ov-file#ch32x-75-lpr-low-budget-pcba-with-low-profile-redragon-switches">CH32X-75</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in designing a keyboard with the CH32X, the kicad sources
for these PCBs are available.</p>
<h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1>
<p>If that sounds interesting enough to give a try, I’d recommend digging through
the firmware code in the
<a href="https://github.com/rgoulter/smart-keymap">smart-keymap</a> repository to figure
out how you might adapt that to your own keyboard.</p>
<p>If you happen to not have a suitable fancy custom keyboard, the
<a href="https://github.com/rgoulter/keyboard-labs#pico42-simple-hand-solderable-pcb-in-bm40jj40-form-factor">Pico42</a>
would be relatively easy to find the parts for &amp; solder. Or, the cost of getting
the PCB fabricated with PCBA for the
<a href="https://github.com/rgoulter/keyboard-labs/releases/tag/ch32x-48-rev2025.4">CH32X-48</a>
is about $5 per PCB, before S&amp;H. (You’d only need to solder the switches, which
is easy to do).</p>
<p>If you’ve already written keyboard firmware that uses keyberon, <a href="https://rgoulter.com/smart-keymap/doc/keyberon_smart_keyboard/index.html#migrating-from-keyberon">I wrote some notes on how migrating from keyberon-based code</a>.</p>
