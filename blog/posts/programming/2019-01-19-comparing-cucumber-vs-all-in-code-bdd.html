<p>A couple of years ago I added a couple of Cucumber specs
to a side-project of mine.<br />
I did this because I was learning to use Cucumber since
I was being hired as a Software Engineer in Test.
(Their existing automated acceptance tests used Cucumber).</p>
<p>I recently picked the project up again to do some maintenance on it,
and I chose to migrate from using Cucumber to using
all-in-code ScalaTest for implementing the same specifications.</p>
<p>When using Cucumber, you must ask “why use Cucumber over an
all-in-code tool like RSpec (or ScalaTest)”.
So, here are some considerations about the trade-offs between
using Cucumber and using all-in-language tests:</p>
<h1 id="recap-cucumber-and-bdd">Recap: Cucumber and BDD</h1>
<p>Cucumber is a tool which enables structuring tests in a
certain way. This structure particularly supports
a “Behaviour Driven Development” (BDD) workflow.<br />
BDD is the idea of specifying behaviours (after having refined
what these behaviours should be from examples).<br />
That is: a specification is an artifact from the project-management side;
and Cucumber is a tool which executes specifications of behaviours.<br />
BDD’s selling point is “build the right product”.
And executable specifications aim to provide
“living documentation” about what the code
actually does.</p>
<p>Well, that’s my understanding of it from Gojko Adzic’s fantastic
“Specification By Example”.</p>
<p>Specifications and Cucumber, from a developers perspective:
- Any automated test involves 3 things:
- Set up some System Under Test (SUT)
- Get the SUT to perform some action
- Check that the SUT did what it was supposed to do.
- Technically, automated tests may also need to clean up
the environment they run in; but this is a technical detail about
running the tests, not a detail about checking the SUT.
- I’ve seen these three steps described with the mnemonic
“Assemble, Act, Assert” which I quite like.
- Typically, documentation about what a program does
is hand-written. (Although there are interesting
tools which try and address this, like
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50332885/how-do-i-install-and-use-gpg-agent-on-windows/50412924#50412924">Java’s Spring’s REST Docs</a>).
- Cucumber’s file format involves describing a “feature”
which is a sequence of “scenarios”. (Roughly corresponding
to “suite” and “test” in xUnit terms). Each scenario
consists of steps.
- For example. from
<a href="https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/v/3-8/docs/built-in-matchers/equality-matchers">rspec-expectations</a>:
<code>cucumber     Given a file named "compare_using_eq.rb" with:       .... Ruby code using RSpec Expectations ....     When I run rspec compare_using_eq.rb     Then the output should contain "3 examples, 0 failures"</code>
- it’s a good convention to write the scenario’s steps
in a “Given/When/Then” sequence;
and this corresponds to “Assemble, Act, Assert”.
- Cucumber’s differentiating feature is that the
executable specification is separate from the code
which runs it.
- i.e. a Cucumber test suite has its executable specification
in a <code>.feature</code> file, written in Gherkin syntax.
This is then executed using test code in “step definitions”.
- My impression is that there are different styles of
writing Given/When/Then steps:
- steps as a convenient way to arrange test code/examples.
e.g. for libraries (or APIs) like RSpec.
This seems to be the easiest kind of product to
write executable specifications for.
- steps as “pseudo code”.
This seems a compromise for getting documentation
which is tested, with less emphasis on readability.
- steps as declared descriptions. This is what I think
is best for high-level end to end specifications.
(Although this ends up with steps which are too vague if they
are too high level and don’t mention any details).</p>
<h1 id="advantages-and-disadvantages-of-each-approach">Advantages and Disadvantages of Each Approach</h1>
<p>Relevant advantages/disadvantages for Cucumber vs all-in-code specs:
(As opposed to inherent difficulties with end-to-end
or out-of-process acceptance tests).</p>
<p>Advantages of Cucumber:
- Cucumber specification features are English-readable in plaintext files.
This is useful if you want to see “what are the specifications?
what does the software do?” at a glance.
- It’s much harder to access the “executable specification”
from in-code specs (like RSpec or ScalaTest’s FeatureSpec).
The “Given/When/Then” are mixed in with the step-execution code.
- Cucumber makes it easier to adhere to an “executable specification
discipline”.
Because scenarios in the Feature file are
idiomatically written with “Given/When/Then” steps,
writing test code outside that convention naturally <em>smells</em>.
- Similarly, if the step-definition code doesn’t “obviously agree”
with the step it’s defining, this is another clear smell.
- It “smells” if the executable specifications aren’t used anywhere.
My experience is that tests tend to be ignored (beyond whether they pass
and maybe coverage metrics); but I think tests could be leveraged
to provide more value than this.
- With all-in-code specs, it’s much easier to be sloppy
and have poorly written specs or poorly engineered code
which tests the code.
- It “smells” if the Feature files aren’t used anywhere.
(IME, It’s typical to ignore tests anyway.
But I think this is a smell).
- It’s easier to produce “living documentation” from a tool like Cucumber
than a tool like RSpec.</p>
<p>Disadvantages of Cucumber:
- Cucumber step-definitions code has a weird “interface”.
“interface” in
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSAYlu0NcY">John Ousterhaut’s use of the word</a>:
“interface” is the stuff you need to be aware of in order to use
code.<br />
- With normal imperative code:
each statement is essentially adjacent to each statement in the program,
or is embedded in some structure like a function or a class.<br />
It’s typically straightforward that the ‘interface’ is all the code
in the function, any incoming parameters; and if unlucky,
access to “global” state.
- With step definitions:
It’s possible that some steps will need to store information for
later steps or make use of information from previous steps.
Steps need to be written in a way that makes the assumed interface
as obvious as possible, at the same time as being an
idiomatic way to describe some step in a test scenario.
- It’s really hard to write good specifications.</p>
<p>Disadvantage of all-in-code specs:
- With code, it’s really tempting to “Dont Repeat Yourself” (DRY)
so that there’s less code to read.<br />
Whereas, tests should “tell a story”. (They should use
“Descriptive and Meaningful Phrases” rather than be ‘DRY’).<br />
With all-in-code specs, if a test step is re-used,
then either subsequent steps are nested (which may be hard to read)
or copy-pasted elsewhere in the test code.
- Cucumber’s approach is to organise test code by step definitions.
So, to see the full code listing for a test scenario,
you have to view each step definition.<br />
Each step may be “DAMP”, but not the whole scenario.</p>
