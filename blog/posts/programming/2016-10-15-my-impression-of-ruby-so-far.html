<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>I’ve recently started programming in Ruby. I’ve inherited a codebase for writing automated-UI tests against a website. The tests make use of Capybara, which provides a high-level “DSL” for interacting with a webpage/browser in the sameway a user would; Capybara itself does this by abstracting over Selenium (or some other driver, like Poltergeist/PhantomJS); Selenium itself allows interaction with different web-browsers, by providing abstractions for different drivers of browsers (e.g. ChromeDriver).</p>
<p>As is also common for tests like these (called “UI tests”, “acceptance tests”, “functional tests”, “specifications”, “end to end tests” depending on who you ask) is use of Cucumber. – But that’s not too important for this post.</p>
<h3 id="very-first-impression">Very First Impression</h3>
<p>Anyway,<br />
I’d first read a few books before getting my hands dirty. (“Ruby Best Practices” and some of “The Ruby Way”). What I read was exciting enough: Ruby seems to be a language with decent pedigree, inheriting aspects from Lisp and the emphasis on message-passing from SmallTalk (as well as e.g. the power of Regular Expressions from Perl).<br />
Also cool was e.g. Ruby’s dynamic features. Everything is an object, objects pass messages between each other. And so by overriding a few magic methods, some pretty cool things can be done. – e.g. the <code>method_missing</code> method is called if the object was called with a method that wasn’t defined on that object; so an object overriding this can have different behaviour.</p>
<p>That Ruby isn’t a low-pedigree language surprised me. ‘cause I kindof thought of Ruby as a “slightly prettier Python”. (It really isn’t, the philosophies of the two languages are quite different).<br />
And while I’d heard Ruby documentation was ’good’, it was ‘good’ by-way-of “here’s an example of probably what you’ll want to do”.<br />
And, well, if all someone knew was “Ruby on Rails”, then it’s kindof a good indicator that that person (prob’ly) doesn’t know how to program.</p>
<p>Steve Yegge also gave the language well-nuanced praise: that he didn’t <em>like</em> the language, but he found himself using it for everything when he had the choice; that he didn’t <em>know</em> the language, but he found he didn’t need to read the documentation while writing it (unlike other languages he was more familiar with).</p>
<h3 id="actually-using-it">Actually Using It</h3>
<p>I’d say, Ruby isn’t as nice a blub language as Python is. To me it feels like a blub language, but with a message-passing system.</p>
<p>I guess I don’t like it as much coming from a Scala background:<br />
“Ruby’s nice ’cause you can map/reduce over lists” … just like Scala. But without pattern matching.<br />
And Ruby has nice “no brackets” syntax … like Scala. (Except in Ruby, it’s like <code>o.m(x,y,z)</code> can be <code>o.m x, y, z</code>; in Scala it’s more like <code>x.op(y)</code> can be written as <code>x op y</code>; in Haskell it’s <code>f(x,y,z)</code> must be written as <code>f x y z</code>). – Also, in Scala, operator overloading works for any symbol which is a valid method name, whereas Ruby takes C++’s approach.</p>
<p>That Ruby has symbols (like Lisp) is one thing I certainly do like about it, though.</p>
<p>And I guess I don’t like it as much coming from a Haskell background:<br />
Say what you like about how shit Haskell documentation can be; (and I suppose outside “being too academic”, large-scale shit like Lenses can be god-damn atrocious to read). But at least it’s clear what <em>types</em> things have.<br />
Ruby documentation makes clear what <em>messages</em> the objects receive. – The expectation is that the documentation give examples of different ways to use the method. Fucking good luck to you if the documentation lacks that. – This is slightly exasperated by Ruby’s “there’s more than one way to skin a monkey” philosophy, wherein a call to the same method-definition with different kinds of arguments ought to do the-right-thing.</p>
<p>And I guess it kind-of, sort-of makes sense for those familiar with Ruby, but I was surprised to learn that methods like <code>map</code>, etc. accept <em>only</em> procs; even if an objects method receives the same type of argument as an equivalent proc, the higher-order methods only take procs.<br />
– The lack of tuples (in the same sense as Haskell or Scala or Python) also seems strange to me.</p>
<p>But the biggest woe I have with Ruby at the moment is “wtf errors”, presumably from the magic. – It’s not completely uncommon in statements calling Capybara (and therefore, Selenium, and ChromeDriver) to throw an <code>&quot;undefined method 'map' for 0:Fixnum</code> (or <code>nil:NilClass</code>), when the statement contains no calls to map, nor any numbers/nil values. (I guess as a hint, the same statement may sometimes throw other errors about connection problems for some pipe).<br />
– i.e. the call-stack from the exception doesn’t show the actual call-stack.<br />
It’s possible, but very difficult, to debug this sort of thing. I still haven’t figured it out.</p>
<p>– All that said; this was on an non-idiomatic codebase I’d inherited. And I’m by no means yet comfortable with writing Ruby.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-hopes">Conclusion / Hopes</h3>
<p>So I find the syntax and semantics of Ruby conflict with what I’d expect, coming from a Scala/Haskell/Python background.<br />
I’m not saying Ruby is a <em>bad</em> language. It looks like it’s pretty nice at writing message-passing paradigm programs. – But I don’t yet have love for the Ruby environment.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="btw-about-cucumber">Btw, About Cucumber</h4>
<p>Cucumber is a tool to help write “executable specifications”. The specification is written in e.g. Gherkin; the main aspect of a Gherkin specification is its sequence of Given/When/Then steps, written in a natural-language like English. – Cucumber tests will then bind these steps to code by matching the steps against a regex, and executing some code for that.<br />
(In terms of “does the program pass tests”, this is kindof a costly abstraction to make, and for programmers-only, it’s easier to just write the executed code directly. – The purported benefit of writing executable specifications is more about communication: first that those involved in writing/reviewing the specification come up with an agreement of what the program ‘is’, &amp; what terminology/phrases to use when discussing it; second that you get a (readable!) “living document” which describes what features the program has).</p>
<p>The automated testing suite is still quite young (currently working on getting it stable). I’m interested in seeing what difficulties come up in maintaining it (both from a technical and ‘social’ standpoint).</p>
