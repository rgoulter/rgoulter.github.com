</div>

<p>So, I’ve blogged a bit about <a href="../../tags/vim.html">Vim</a>.<br />
Again, no, it’s not about “vim vs emacs”, so much as about “which features your text editing has”; and the vi-like modal editing fantastic for manipulating text.</p>
<p>Recently I’ve had the fortune of programming in Scala.<br />
The joke is that some programmers are happy to work in Scala because it’s not Java, the rest are sad to work in Scala because it’s not Haskell.<br />
Scala is by no means an excellent language. (Again, there are two kinds of languages; those people use, and those people complain about). But I like it well enough.</p>
<p>For the most part, I’ve done my Scala editing in Scala IDE, which is a plugin built upon the much-maligned Eclipse.<br />
– Overall, the biggest complaint to be had about Scala IDE, from my experience, is that ScalaTest can be a bit finicky, and will often refuse to “run all tests in package” or so.</p>
<p>– If I’m harping on about the benefits of Vim, why make use of Eclipse?<br />
Well, for one, I have the Vrapper plugin installed. This is a great stop-gap measure; it doesn’t have every binding (by default, at least), and occasionally messes up, but mostly does the job. (When I had to use XCode, XVim was also a nice plugin to have).<br />
Using Eclipse was the <em>pragmatic</em> best-of-what’s-available.</p>
<p>I’ve recently tried out making use of Vim proper for Scala editing:<br />
I love autocomplete; to get autocompletion for Scala in Vim, the easiest way is using some omnicomplete front-end (like YouCompleteMe), and plugging Eclim as a ‘back-end’ to it. – Eclim can communicate with Eclipse, and provide the autocompletion. – The <em>downside</em> to this is Vim becomes <em>heavy-weight</em>. Like, really heavy. I’m fairly sure you have to disable automatic project-building, also, otherwise there’s a huge lag every time you save. <em>That</em> isn’t great. (As it was for me, without the automatic building, there’s still noticeable/significant lag when saving, if using Eclim).</p>
<p>The benefit is you get to use all the customisations/plugins Vim proper has.<br />
e.g. vim-surround is quite useful for editing Scala.</p>
<p>My workstation setup in my lab has two monitors.<br />
For the most part, unless you’re using a keyboard-based window-manager like XMonad, I’m inclined to believe that two monitors isn’t all that enhancing to productivity: If you can, with your keyboard, switch between workspaces; within a terminal, use tmux to switch between tabs/panes, then your keyboard becomes your second monitor. The benefit of added screen real-estate is countered by the cost of moving your mouse to the other window (unless you’re using a keyboard-based window manager, where you can easily/quickly switch focus without use of mouse. Alt-Tab doesn’t suffice).<br />
– I’ve found a use for my second monitor:<br />
SBT has a feature (which can surely be scripted for other tools/environments) that will run a command any time the source-files change. I’ve found it useful to set up two panes on my alternate monitor: one pane will run this loop with the “not slow”-tests, the other pane will run whatever program I’m working on. – Benefits/drawbacks of the latter are, of course, “your mileage may vary”.</p>
<p>Also, make sure if you’re building a binary-search function, you don’t leave out the base case.</p>
<p>– Anyway, the benefit of setting up this is it’s, again, a stop-gap measure for “vim not showing me syntax errors”.<br />
Yes, vim <em>does</em> have that feature. Syntastic is nice enough; though (due to Vim’s age), doesn’t just-work as well as in Eclipse, and doesn’t do the red-squiggly-lines thing.<br />
Quickfix is the more ‘legacy’ equivalent. And Quickfix is really nice (I’ve used it for an OCaml project). But the equivalent “sbt compile” takes a <em>long</em> time to run. SBT itself compensates for this by providing a REPL/shell, which is quicker, but doesn’t fit the vim/makeprg model. – <a href="https://notes.pinboard.in/u:rgoulter/47e14b69d902db1e0146">There seem to be some Vim/SBT integrations</a>, but I’ve not tried any of them. (The general theme is <em>they</em> will integrate with quickfix).<br />
– If it’s not too distracting, it certainly is useful to have an at-a-glance view of “did I break anything?”, though, so it’s not strictly inferior in and of itself.</p>
<p>There are other things I more/less miss from Eclipse.<br />
e.g. Eclipse’s editing just has a more “solid” feel to it, like you’re editing building blocks. This is probably the whole press-enter-to-select-option.<br />
No doubt Vim can be customised to match this, but some of the auto-insertions are nice. (And, yes, provide nice inspirations for what an editor should have).<br />
Convenience features like automatically-import-a-class which wasn’t otherwise in scope is useful.<br />
– Particularly, though, and an example of “how good is your tooling” is “show type under cursor”. (These strongly typed languages, with type inference, like Scala, Haskell and OCaml, more/less demand editors with this feature).</p>
<p>– But another big difference between these is this:<br />
When I’m using Eclipse, I put up with any inefficiency.<br />
When I’m using Vim, I’m imagining what I could have to improve my tooling, what features would be nice to have to make things nicer.</p>
