<p>Many programmers who maintain a blog, I believe, use it as a kind of note-keeping place. Programmer-y stuff can be hard; it’s easy to forget what steps to take when building some program on some distribution – especially what difficulties come up, how to overcome them.<br />
– I’ve used my blog for that.</p>
<p>I’ve also kept a programming journal.<br />
I’m not sure how common this is; I’ve never met anyone who’s done the same. One of the techniques I used was, perhaps in a similar vein to de Bono’s Thinking Hats, making use of colour: red was for things which went wrong (e.g. compiler errors which I didn’t know how to fix), green was for questions (e.g. how does X work? why is it doing that?), blue for facts, black for thoughts, purple for new ideas. – That is, when making notes, it’s useful to distinguish different kinds of thoughts.</p>
<p>When working on my Bachelor of Computing Dissertation, my Final Year Project (FYP), I also made use of Microsoft’s OneNote, in tandem with this journal-writing.<br />
– During my FYP, there were several aspects to the project which would be fun to explore at the start (e.g. how to write Eclipse plugins, inter-process communication between different programs using e.g. Apache Thrift, BNFs of the C grammar, diagrams of ASTs of various C declarations, etc.). - For this, I did prefer to write with pen &amp; paper: I’ve got a decently sized 5-partition folder filled with my notes for these (&amp; relevant print-outs).<br />
OneNote was damn useful for maintaining a series of project-related links. Early on in my FYP I was trying to compile CERN’s Cling (a C++ interpreter) on Windows. I never had any success; but OneNote was invaluable in keeping notes like the output of commands, comments from similar efforts, etc.</p>
<p>From my use and experience, being “searchable” wasn’t such a big deal. (<em>I</em> knew roughly where what I was looking for would be.). This is mitigated by OneNote’s hierarchy UX:<br />
– What I like about OneNote, in lieu of my technique with ‘colours’ to shape thought, is that OneNote naturally shapes thought into hierarchies: a notebook has sections; sections have pages; a page is where you write, either with paragraphs, or with bullet points: it’s really, really easy to make (and remove) bullet points. (typing “*” is enough for OneNote to say “hey, this is a bullet point”.).<br />
Of course, being able to paste links in is useful. And there’re icons you can (quite easily) embellish bulletpoints with (like “Important!” icon, etc.).</p>
<p>Emacs’s Org mode is … not software I’ve used.<br />
It’s “life changing” for those who do make use of it. (Apparently it’s also a nice gateway drug to Emacs. Though key aspects of Org mode exist in Vim plugins, so there’s that.).<br />
– A key philosophy behind Org mode is the idea that ‘notes’ &amp; ‘tasks’ are inter-dependent: when you note things, you’re likely to then come up with tasks; and when you manage tasks, you’re likely to note things down.<br />
At-a-glance, it looks like Emacs’ Org mode has a bunch of fancy .. interfaces, views of data: this data, written in a plain textfile, appears it’s somewhat similar to OneNote: an Org file has headings (and sub-headings, and sub-sub-..), within a heading can have the paragraphs, bullet points, etc.; each heading can have meta-data associated with it (which is where “tasks” come into it), in terms of “TODO/DONE”, custom tags, deadlines, priority, or custom properties.<br />
– There’s supposedly other fancy tosh like export-to-PDF. That I can’t say I care for.</p>
<p>A key advantage to Org mode (in native Emacs, or whether in one of the Vim ports) would be ‘lightweight’-ness compared to OneNote. (You <em>can</em> make use of OneNote on Linux, but that’d have to be by opening a web browser. Thus, internet connection required..).<br />
But I am wondering how well Org mode’s ease-of-use, in terms of inputting bullet points/etc., compares to OneNote.<br />
I’m also wondering whether, in lay usage, the fancy different-perspectives/searching really make that much of a difference.</p>

    <title>Case Study in Vim Plugin Development</title>

</div>

<p>I don’t know a lot about writing plugins.<br />
My own experience goes as far as trying to write a plugin for Eclipse (which gets <em>very</em> complicated as soon as a plugin isn’t a “monolithic” bundle); as well as writing a quite small plugin for my <a href="https://github.com/rgoulter/c-worksheet.vim">C worksheet</a>. (The fanciest thing it does is to download a JAR archive dependency if not present in the system.).</p>
<p>So I’m not particularly qualified to say what is or isn’t a good plugin architecture, etc.</p>
<p>I recently came across the problem: “In Vim, use <code>*</code> to find next occurence of current selection in visual mode”.<br />
Vim doesn’t offer this behaviour out of the box.<br />
The fella on IRC was using <a href="https://github.com/nelstrom/vim-visual-star-search">nelstrom/vim-visual-star-search</a>. The readme for this somewhat helpfully links to <a href="https://github.com/thinca/vim-visualstar">thinca/vim-visualstar</a>. – Neither of these repos is outstandingly popular.</p>
<p>Nelstrom remarks “Looks like it uses a lot more code to do pretty much the same thing. Is it better?”.</p>
<p>Nelstrom’s plugin is simple enough to show here:</p>
<pre><code>&quot; From http://got-ravings.blogspot.com/2008/07/vim-pr0n-visual-search-mappings.html

&quot; makes * and # work on visual mode too.
function! s:VSetSearch(cmdtype)
  let temp = @s
  norm! gv&quot;sy
  let @/ = &#39;\V&#39; . substitute(escape(@s, a:cmdtype.&#39;\&#39;), &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;g&#39;)
  let @s = temp
endfunction

xnoremap * :&lt;C-u&gt;call &lt;SID&gt;VSetSearch(&#39;/&#39;)&lt;CR&gt;/&lt;C-R&gt;=@/&lt;CR&gt;&lt;CR&gt;
xnoremap # :&lt;C-u&gt;call &lt;SID&gt;VSetSearch(&#39;?&#39;)&lt;CR&gt;?&lt;C-R&gt;=@/&lt;CR&gt;&lt;CR&gt;

&quot; recursively vimgrep for word under cursor or selection if you hit leader-star
nmap &lt;leader&gt;* :execute &#39;noautocmd vimgrep /\V&#39; . substitute(escape(expand(&quot;&lt;cword&gt;&quot;), &#39;\&#39;), &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;g&#39;) . &#39;/ **&#39;&lt;CR&gt;
vmap &lt;leader&gt;* :&lt;C-u&gt;call &lt;SID&gt;VSetSearch()&lt;CR&gt;:execute &#39;noautocmd vimgrep /&#39; . @/ . &#39;/ **&#39;&lt;CR&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Thinca’s is <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thinca/vim-visualstar/master/plugin/visualstar.vim">certainly longer</a>:</p>
<pre><code>function! s:search(type, g)
  let s:count = v:count1 . a:type
  let reg = &#39;&quot;&#39;
  let [save_reg, save_type] = [getreg(reg), getregtype(reg)]
  normal! gv&quot;&quot;y
  let text = @&quot;
  call setreg(reg, save_reg, save_type)

  let [pre, post] = [&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;]
  if !a:g
    ....
  endif

  let text = substitute(escape(text, &#39;\&#39; . a:type), &quot;\n&quot;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;g&#39;)

  let @/ = &#39;\V&#39; . pre . text . post
  call histadd(&#39;/&#39;, @/)
endfunction</code></pre>
<p>(Code truncated at <code>....</code> for brevity).</p>
<p>With my current proficiency, I’m sure Nelstrom writes closer to how I’d write:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cites any sources / close inspiration.</p></li>
<li><p>Leaves comments explaining anything non-trivial. (Which Thinca doesn’t do AT ALL. Not even for functions!).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Even from this snippet it’s clear that Thinca’s is of higher quality. I’d base that one the use of functions to do caretaking of the editor environment. – It’s not clear what the argument <code>g</code> is for (like the <code>g</code> in substitute?), but the ommitted lines seem to take care of some edge case.<br />
– Something to note, I guess, it seems that in both cases the VimL is ‘impure’ in providing read-only info. (Again, I’m not sure if it’s possible to get this without the caretaking.).</p>
<p>Not hatin’ on Nelstrom: while the Vim community has some excellent plugins, I think most Vim users don’t bother touching VimL enough to learn how to do this kindof thing.</p>

<p>Came across <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheComicalConservative/photos/a.133361476797039.26402.133352176797969/626100744189774/?type=1">this</a> on Facebook:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Liberal: I am pro-choice<br />
Me: Can I choose my own health care?<br />
Liberal: No.<br />
Me: Can I choose what I do with money I earn?<br />
Liberal: No.<br />
Me: Can I choose how I defend my family and possessions?<br />
Liberal: No.<br />
Me: What can I choose?<br />
Liberal: An abortion, and a same sex marriage.<br />
Me: I don’t agree with your opinions.<br />
Liberal: OH MY GOD STOP OPPRESSING ME YOU RACIST SEXIST BIGOT!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s not particularly hard to figure out that this comes from a socially-conservative poster.<br />
I wouldn’t criticise this post for the quality of its opinion; but what’s perhaps disappointing is the “the guy I disagree with is so stupid” nature to it. It’d be unfair, though, to say that this attitude is unique to this post (or to social conservatives).</p>
<p>Lately I’ve been listening to some of Jonathon Haidt’s talks/lectures.<br />
In particular</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b86dzTFJbkc">‘Why conservatives don’t like social justice and science’</a>, in which Haidt discusses is “Righteous Mind” thesis, how humans develop morality in regards to care/loyalty/etc., and discussing socially liberal and conservative attitudes in regards to this. Haidt finishes the talk with a resounding criticism of the social sciences discrimination against conservatives. (– Ha, Karen Straughan chips in in the comments section).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3o-F94S4FI">‘How Common Threats Make for Common Ground’</a> (TED talk), in which Haidt points out this hyper-partisanship makes each side deny the looming threats we face, since each threat has become a political issue.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOu_8yoqZoQ">‘Three Stories About Capitalism’</a> (TED talk), in which Haidt discusses that some problems are “wicked problems” since they invoke our moral beliefs to resolve them, and the political disagreement over capitalism,</li>
<li>and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OnTTWkAv_E">this talk to some law students</a> (somewhat pessimistic).</li>
</ul>
<p>Haidt is a social psychologist; one of his main theses is that, lately, American politics has become extremely polarised. Roughly, in “The Righteous Mind” he points out our morality brings people together, but also divides us, as we sacrilise things which are “good”, and so anything opposing it is “bad”.<br />
e.g. social liberals ‘sacrilise’ women’s rights, so the women’s right to choose abortion is far more important than a fetus’ “right to live” or so.<br />
– The utterly refreshing thing about these lectures from Haidt is the utterly neutral way he discusses the social left/right.</p>
<p>With that in mind, (great if you’ve seen any of the videos, but in any case):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Liberal: I am pro-choice</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Pro-choice” is a heavily charged term used to refer to a pro-abortion attitude (as opposed to “pro life” [or “anti-choice”]).<br />
It seems a slightly mis-placed phrasing. Though, as with many arguments, what’s under attack is the Liberal’s <strong>sincerity</strong> about “people should be free to do what they want”.</p>
<p>Haidt discussed that, while everyone values “liberty”.<br />
The social left means “liberty” as in enabling everyone to have the freedom to choose what to do. (e.g. everyone should be able to go to college.).<br />
The social right means “liberty” as in not interfering with individual choices. (e.g. don’t tax successful people more for being successful.).</p>
<p>Next, the post somewhat attacks the liberal attitudes on some points:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: Can I choose my own health care?<br />
Me: Can I choose what I do with money I earn?<br />
Me: Can I choose how I defend my family and possessions?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Briefly,<br />
‘Can I choose my own health care?’ ObamaCare seems to’ve been quite nasty for the middle class.<br />
‘Can I choose what I do with money I earn?’ is slightly poorly phrased. Social conservatives prefer small government / lower taxes; but any taxation would still be the govt imposing what an individual does with the money. I mean, I think with better phrasing, (perhaps “Will I be rewarded for working harder than others, and taxed at the same rate as everyone else?”) it’d be easier to push a conservative viewpoint.<br />
‘Can I choose how I defend my family and possessions?’ is an unfortunate one; the second amendment issue seems politically charged, and I understand only in the US is anyone so in favour of ‘civilians having assault rifles’. (Though, e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSk1UkqBx58">Dana Loesch</a> seems to be able to argue quite well in favour).</p>
<p>Again, this is all “look how un-liberal the social left’s attitudes are”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: What can I choose? Liberal: An abortion, and a same sex marriage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Somewhat interesting to note that these two things are abhorrent to the religious right.</p>
<p>You’d think a socially conservative attitude, in favour of a limited government, would be argue something more like “it’s not the government’s duty to interfere with individual liberty in these matters, [even if they are abhorrent]”.<br />
It’s certainly a more interesting argument than “it’s morally right for this to be able to happen, why is it not legal?”.</p>
<p>Still, this certainly makes the post look tacky.<br />
For the social left, it’s great that a woman can have an abortion, and that two people who love each other can marry!<br />
– I guess what’s intended is a mocking along the lines of “this is the only ‘liberty’ the social left cares about[; they don’t <strong>really</strong> care about liberty, like we do]”. And America is all about liberty/freedom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: I don’t agree with your opinions. Liberal: OH MY GOD STOP OPPRESSING ME YOU RACIST SEXIST BIGOT!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This part doesn’t flow at all from the rest.<br />
Again, with regards to Haidt, the social left ‘sacrilises’ the oppressed; so, anyone who disagrees with the left is a ‘racist’, is a ‘sexist’.<br />
Also fun is that these words short-circuit argument. To be ‘racist’ is to be a heathen to the social left. Anything ‘racist’ is bad, and so it’s not worth considering the argument, because of course anything ‘racist’ cannot be true.</p>
<p>Adding to the depiction of the Liberal as someone who doesn’t care about liberty, this paints the Liberal as someone who isn’t into civilised discourse, as well as someone who is incapable of defending their opinion.</p>
<p>I guess what’s disappointing is that, rather than simply saying “social conservative attitudes aren’t dumb”, the post reaches further and says “social left attitudes are dumb”. It’d be just as easy to make a similar “social right attitudes are dumb” post, which would almost certainly be similarly tacky.</p>

<p>Shot(s): <a href="https://medium.com/@maradydd/when-nerds-collide-31895b01e68c">When Nerds Collide</a> by <span class="citation">@maradydd</span> / Meredith Patterson, 2014 Mar (Bonus: <a href="https://medium.com/@maradydd/okay-feminism-its-time-we-had-a-talk-about-empathy-bd6321c66b37">Okay, Feminism, It’s Time We Had a Talk About Empathy</a>, 2013 Oct).<br />
Chaser: <a href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=6642">Meredith Patterson’s valient effort is probably doomed</a> by <span class="citation">@esrtweet</span> / Eric S. Raymond, 2015 Jan.</p>
<p>Well, at least ERS hedges by saying ‘probably’.</p>
<p>I read the above two pieces from Patterson some time ago.<br />
‘When Nerds Collide’ is a particularly brilliant piece of writing you should go read. In short, it’s a response to the tensions which come up in terms of tech and ‘inclusivity’. THe piece is filled with a plethora of amazing points, but at its core discusses the idea of a “weird nerd”, who was previously rejected by mainstream culture but now happens to wield power.<br />
The ‘peace offering’ here is more of a “you want inclusivity? here’s how you can have that.”; it’s a call for respect/construction rather than aggression/destruction.</p>
<p>(The second essay isn’t bad, either, but whereas the aforementioned essay is inclined to use progressive lingo, this one uses techie lingo and suggests that many of the efforts in the “women in tech” issue make for anti-patterns.).</p>
<p>I came across ERS’ above essay when someone linked to it on Twitter as part of a culture-war over some GitHub repo.<br />
The key line used was “total rejection of the SJW doctrine”.</p>
<p>It’s not a bad piece of writing.<br />
But it’s not a piece of writing which is going to make any friends. It’s clearly not written to be the kind of article which makes friends. – <em>except maybe</em>, maybe those who transcend the tribalism and genuinely care about “justice and inclusion”.</p>
<p>Yet, ERS’ does include the key phrase “defense of hacker culture”; maradydd’s writing more/less features this term, also.<br />
– If there is any kind of peace offering in ERS’ piece, “shut up and show us the code”; the same conclusion maradydd’s piece ends with.</p>
<p>I don’t think any “kumbaya, let’s all sit around the campfire and be friends” attitude can outright reject ERS’ piece. At least, “ERS = bad, maradydd = good” seems as unlikely to win friends as “SJWs = bad, hackers = good”.<br />
Hostile tone aside, iterate the points of ERS’ piece without hostility. (e.g.; as with <strong>pretty much every argument</strong>, “the other side aren’t <strong>sincere</strong> in caring about the values they say they care about, otherwise they’d do …”, “some bullying happens guised as ‘being inclusive’. This is concerning.”, etc.). – Perhaps a more neutral way of phrasing a conclusion would be “be inclusive, but have zero tolerance for bullying” or so.</p>
<p>In any case, what I note foremost from this is how ERS’ post manages to be much more hostile than maradydd’s (“they’re the enemy / we can’t let them gain an inch”) while following the same kinds of points.<br />
ERS’ piece is much more radical / radicalising than maradydd’s more grounded piece.<br />
And it’s concerning that such a tribalistic “they’re the enemy / we’re the good guys” (and therefore, any action we do is righteous, and action they do is evil) follows so closely from a more reasonable piece.</p>
<p>– Whether “code is without morality” (similar to “numbers don’t lie, interpretations do”?) holds or not is <em>probably</em> a point of contention to be had, among other points, but that can be considered some other time.<br />
I’d be more interested to transcend the arguing here and consider the tribalism and all this “kumbaya” shit, how people interact &amp; communicate (or don’t) in online places; the evils of (self-)righteousness, why it’s so much easier to spot that the other guy is an asshole (and of course you aren’t).</p>

</div>

<p>Recently I’ve finished playing <strong>Valkyria Chronicles</strong> and <strong>If My Heart Had Wings</strong>.<br />
<strong>Valkyria Chronicles</strong>, recently released for PC (earlier released on PlayStation 3) is a strategy game; featuring a bunch of cute boys &amp; girls in cutesy uniforms with rifles in an almost WWII-esque setting.<br />
<strong>If My Heart Had Wings</strong> is a ‘visual novel’; the story is about friends at a school who build &amp; fly a glider.</p>
<p>Spoilers prob’ly follow. You’ve been warned.</p>
<p>Both of these stories are anime-esque (coming from Japan), and both feature elements of romance; though, IMMHW is more focused on this aspect.<br />
I’d love to compare how the elements of narrative used in these stories compared to the (written-in-the-US) Romance Novels I know &amp; love.<br />
Admittedly, it’s a rather small and not particularly representative “sample”; I doubt many of the comparisons here extend too far.</p>
<p>VC is awfully concise in its narrative; there’re some very sweet romance-y bits in the story, though. The story is a bit camp, but one of the lines which sticks with me from the romance between Alicia and Welkin is Alicia’s declaration: “with you I’m not scared anymore”. (Or something like that).<br />
– Compared to RNs: it wouldn’t be so out of place; though, VC naturally lends itself to a much more action-oriented plot than most RNs tend to have. - My impression, though, is RNs, with so much focus on for-women-by-women, will tend to try and have more ‘girl power’ to them. So, dialogue like “I can’t live without you” isn’t uncommon, but I’m sure I can’t recall any story where anyone said “I rely on you” to the other.<br />
Overall, VC doesn’t spend so much time on its romances. The boy and the girl like each other. They do stuff together. There’s kindof a “look I love you” moment, but not particularly any ‘internal conflict’ between the characters. But it’s not particularly a huge focus of the game/story, so oh well.</p>
<p>I’d’ve thought IMMHW would’ve had more sex scenes in it, from the hoo-hah everyone seems to make about the restoration-patch, and all the “people think I’m a loser, but jokes on them, I’ve got a wheelchair-girlfriend” type comments/reviews on Steam.<br />
See, in some of the sexier RNs, there’s gotta be sex by, like, page 20 otherwise it’s considered boring. – IMMHW isn’t so quick to the chase. (Difference in medium may have something to do with that.).<br />
– Sexuality/identity, and sexual representation are waaay different in IMHHW than in the RNs. I mean, those who’re inclined to be offended by a ‘sexist’ trope would find plenty to complain about in IMMHW.</p>
<p>– Part of this is inevitably due to the difference in media between VNs and RNs: even in RNs plenty of people will get upset at the way a story was told. (Things like: ‘the hero was kindof a douchebag, the heroine deserved better’.). With VNs, choices are made which determine the outcome of which girl the main character ends up with.<br />
Sometimes IMMHW did this nicely; you choose which girl you want to spend time with, and the dialogue builds intimacy between the characters. – One particular choice, though, “whose swimsuit/boobs look the best?” is … certainly not something you’d see in RNs.</p>
<p>– On the otherhand, perhaps there’s also plenty to celebrate? In IMMHW, there’re many female characters: The school council’s president is female: authorative, fair, and compassionate. The senior student who was building the glider is female: she’s slightly eccentric, super smart, though with some faults. The other members of the glider club, who study hard to understand aeronautics, work hard to build and maintain the glider, are female. – None of these girls are treated as less for being female; the narrative shows no surprise or novelty that these characters are female. These characters aren’t treated as one-dimensional sex kittens.<br />
– It’s a cute tease, but IMMHW does pass the Bechdel test. (Not sure how many RNs would pass that; though, Bechdel test seems more of an arbitrary thing for people to be able to cry ‘sexist’ over, so <em>shrug</em>.).<br />
RNs main strength is character; mostly just the main hero/heroine. IMMHW has many characters, perhaps not all with the same depth as the H/H in RNs, but not paricularly flat characters, either.</p>
<p>That there’s a ‘choice’ of which partner to pick is somewhat quaint.<br />
In (modern) RNs, it’s fairly conventional that by the end of the second chapter or so, you’ll know who the main Hero and Heroine are, and that they’ll be end the story Happily-Ever-After. - In IMMHW, it’s not (to me) as apparent, given the breadth/depth of characters featured.<br />
(I’ve only played through one ‘route’ of IMMHW. I’m not sure how inferior/shorter other ‘routes’ of the story may be. – In some sense, VNs compare to Choose Your Own Adventure stories. Choose Your Own Romance?).<br />
– Maybe a bad example, but if Twilight where CYOR, it’d make the whole ‘Team Edward’/‘Team Jacob’ thing more fun. ;P</p>

<p>There’s a somewhat famous styled git log I have in my config. The guy I grabbed it from said it was from <a href="https://github.com/ndbroadbent/scm_breeze">scm-breeze</a>, I think maybe he meant tiimgreen’s <a href="https://github.com/tiimgreen/github-cheat-sheet#styled-git-log">github-cheat-sheet</a>. In any case, The Git one is like:</p>
<pre><code>alias gl=&quot;git log --graph --pretty=format:&#39;%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)&lt;%an&gt;%Creset&#39; --abbrev-commit&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Consulting <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/pretty-formats">the docs</a>, (who does that, right?), it’s not insane to figure out what this is doing:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>%h</code> - abbrev commit hash</li>
<li><code>%d</code> - ref names (like <code>(origin/master)</code>)</li>
<li><code>%s</code> - subject (first line of commit)</li>
<li><code>%cr</code> - committer date, relative.</li>
<li><code>%an</code> - author name.</li>
</ul>
<p>Great.<br />
But I’ve been using HG. Can Mercurial haz it, too?<br />

</ul>
<p>I’m trying for “direct equivalence”. YMMV, since Git/HG don’t exactly share all concepts. (e.g. every commit in HG has the notion of a ‘branch’, etc.).<br />
So, note that when building the template, this is the stuff to put within the <code>{}</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>node|short</code> - commit hash</li>
<li><code>rev</code> - int, revision number.</li>
<li><code>branches</code>/<code>branch</code> - branchname.</li>
<li><code>desc|strip|firstline</code> - ‘subject’</li>
<li><code>date|age</code> - human-readable difference in time.</li>

<p>So, my <code>.hgrc</code> has:</p>
<pre><code>[color]
custom.rev = red
custom.decorate = yellow

<p>With the hg alias: <code>alias hl=&quot;hg log --style ~/.hgrc.d/fancy.style&quot;</code>. (Or do this from your shell, whatever).</p>
<p>And, finally, <code>~/.hgrc.d/fancy.style</code> is:</p>
<pre><code>changeset = &quot;* {label(&#39;custom.rev&#39;, node|short)} - ({label(&#39;custom.decorate&#39;, branch)}) {desc|strip|firstline} ({label(&#39;custom.date&#39;, date|age)}) &lt;{label(&#39;custom.author&#39; , author)}&gt;\n&quot;</code></pre>

</div>

<p>So, at the moment I’m sludging through Sherry Thomas’ latest, &amp; first Contemporary, “The One in my Heart”.<br />
There’s lots to not-enjoy about it. (Like the character lamenting the lack of timeless marriage, at the same time as looking at her phone during lunch with her partner). Whatever. The bigger issue for the Romance Novel here is that there’s zero (internal) conflict between the characters: the hero is utterly perfect, and utterly in love with the heroine; has been for ages. And the heroine is utterly perfect, and utterly in love with the hero; has been for ages. <strong>Sighhhhh.</strong></p>
<p>So. Romance Novel, but main characters aren’t great. Gotcha.<br />
There has to be at least <strong>some</strong> conflict*, though: the hero wants to reconcile with his parents (minus having to say sorry. <strong>Sighhhhhh.</strong>). The heroine wants a relationship with the hero. So, naturally, doesn’t want a fake-relationship with the hero. Because. <strong>Sighhhhhhhhhhh.</strong>.<br />
– The thing is, and the narrative even admits, both of these problems could be solved in five minutes. If the hero just talked to his parents. Or the heroine just said to the hero, (who obviously, completely obviously digs her) that she likes him.<br />
And because it can be solved so quickly, it’s <strong>really</strong> hard to get behind the characters. It’s just really silly.</p>
<p>The fun thing is, though, like: with Romance Novels, you know it’s going to be a “Happily Ever After”. It doesn’t matter that you know (roughly) what the ending is going to be, it’s more interesting how the conflict is going to be resolved.</p>
<p>Rather, if the problem can be solved in five minutes, then the pages between the establishment of the narrative, and the climax/conclusion of the book, are really just words filling in space. – <strong>Which can be fine.</strong> But it’s usually better to distract the reader, throw them off the scent that the conflict isn’t hard.</p>
<p>(Come to think of it, “deus ex machina” is kindof the opposite; a super-hard problem is established, but ‘solved’ in a super-short amount of time..).</p>
<p>It’s not just Romance Novels which are guilty of this, as such.<br />
SciFi/Fantasy can totally play the same game, too.<br />
RASalvatore’s stories were notorious at this: early on, the narrative shows some cool bag-of-tricks which the bad guy has. e.g. the ability to teleport someone in order to assassinate them. Like. If you can do that, you can kill the ‘good guy’ in five minutes. Of course there are “rules” to it. But when the narrator arbitrarily awards convenience magic to good/bad guys.. the plot can hardly be more than 5 minutes from resolution at any point in time.<br />
– Perhaps the best example would be “Siege of Darkness”, where during a relentless siege the ‘bad guys’ just happen to pack up &amp; leave.</p>
<p>In terms of “pages filling space”, Salvatore’s writing was fairly solid here: the heroes are tired, but have to press on. Then some more fighting, so the heroes are even more tired, but they have to press on even more urgently, but then there’s even more fighting, etc. etc.</p>
<p>– But considering stories I’ve liked:<br />
“Seducing Mr Knightly”: I love this book so much. In terms of the core plot: the body of the story is filled with flirtations between Annabelle and Knightly. It might be possible to trim this down to a skeleton of around three key encounters. Maybe. But since so much of the story is about Annabelle’s growth/transformation, it’s never 5-minutes away from the end.<br />
“Devil in Winter”: There’s just so much character development/growth going on here, that it’s not 5-minutes-then-done.<br />
“High Fidelity”: This book isn’t really about ‘plot’, so much as a collection of biographic-esque monologues, for different situations.</p>
<p>– So. Conflicts which can be solved “in 5 minutes” aren’t inherently bad. But it takes a lot of effort, and a lot of talent to maintain a plotline through a holding place, waiting for the end of the story. (Oddly enough, reader is probably also waiting for things to progress..).</p>
<hr />
<p>*Ideas to make this pairing more interesting: The heroine is a materials scientist. The Hero is a doctor/surgeon. It’s okay for them to be a “love interest” in an “aliens invading the city, these two have to find a counter-weapon” plot. Explosions, excitement!<br />
Or, sticking to the romance-novel genre: give points of tension between the character, which can’t be solved quickly: maybe the hero is with a girl. Not a girl who’s vain/materialistic/morally-bad, etc., but a girl who would make a good HEA. <strong>That</strong> would make the story more interesting.<br />
Or perhaps the hero/heroine disagree on things which are important to them: maybe he finds his work important, she finds his time important (or vice versa).<br />
etc. but the given conflict is “not really a problem”. :/</p>

</div>

<p>It’s kindof cute that all programmers, if they’ve worked on any project for a long enough time before learning about VCS, surely all take the same approach to novice “version control”. e.g. Keeping folders/copies as snapshots of how the code looked at that time. – We weren’t all born knowing how to use VCS. (Though, maybe those who didn’t bother to play around with programming a lot outside of class never faced this).</p>
<p>I’d be astounded if anyone with even only a basic grasp of VCS kept to doing things this way. VCS is obviously that much better at keeping versions.</p>
<p>But, uh. One thing which is still not uncommon to see is, as an answer to the anxiety of “not sure if <em>this function</em> is something I’m going to need later (even though I don’t need it now). I’d better just comment it out.”.<br />
It’s really quick and easy to use a decent text editor to comment/uncomment out a chunk of code. (Even the kids who don’t learn vim/emacs can do this in the text editors of IDEs).<br />
This strikes me as a ‘dirty’ solution; it sounds like you’d want some <em>version</em> of the function handy. – And surely with VCS available, there shouldn’t be any doubt as to being able to get a copy of this function back if you delete it.</p>
<p>I’m not sure I’ve met anyone who can do this well. I don’t think that’s necessarily a reflection on skill in VCS (it’s not as if anyone <strong>really</strong> needs to do somersaults in VCS all the time. … It’s probably not very good if you do have to), but perhaps this is a “common enough” thing which VCS doesn’t make accessible?<br />
Rephrasing so as to be more precise/specific: if there’s some hunk of text (e.g. a function which we’d otherwise comment out) is removed in a commit, which isn’t necessarily the only modification in a commit, how to ‘recover’ this hunk of text into the current working copy of the file? (Bonus points if the function we want to recover isn’t the only modified hunk in the commit).</p>
<p>Common enough answer of ‘how to do this’ is to look at the commit, copy-paste the hunk, and maybe remove the +‘s/-’s (the first column of the modified lines in the commit difference).<br />
This also feels ’dirty’, and a bit wasteful. Especially if there’re many lines in the hunk. (Vim’s visual mode would mitigate this, sortof, but still).</p>
<p>Checking out a commit/file, and copying the function directly, also feels … tedious.<br />
I was surprised to learn Vim/Fugitive makes this not insanely brutal to pull off, though: the command <code>Glog</code> on a file in VCS will put the history of the file in a location list, so the different versions of a file can be easily traversed.<br />
Though, again, it may be tedious to find which function you want to copy. (In principle, anyway, if not in practice!).</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> what I’m after is closer to the following:<br />
<code>git diff R R^ &gt; foo.diff</code> outputs a (“reverse”) of the commit. You can then either edit this <code>foo.diff</code> file, deleting the hunks you don’t want (tedious!, except for the pertinent hunk), which we can then <code>git apply foo.diff</code>. (Assuming the hunk is still relevant!).<br />
Alternatively, just applying the diff (without editing it), one could then <code>git checkout --patch -- .</code> (assuming the repo was otherwise in a clean state before applying the diff..).<br />
This is tedious, still, but it’s plausible that a script could perform this (“recover some hunk(s) from a commit [which removed them]”), with that assumption that a hunk could be applied to the working copy. (As far as I understand, if a file has changed so much that Git/VCS can’t figure out how to apply the diff, then this can’t work either).</p>
<p>None of this seems a “great” solution to the problem, though.</p>

</div>

<p>Maybe in my previous postings on this topic I’ve come across as a little harsh on RASalvatore, and perhaps it seems that I think all Romance Novels do character well.</p>
<p>Okay. That’s obviously not going to be true.<br />
But I’d still like to consider Katherine Ashe’s novella from the “At the Billionaire’s Wedding” anthology with regards to conflict in the narrative. And, like, how well “character development = internal conflict, plot = external conflict” model holds up.</p>
<p>The “At the Billionaire’s Wedding” anthology takes place in the setting of the wedding of Maya Rodale’s Duke Austen and Jane Sparks. (If you figured out giving the husband’s surname to the wife makes for “Jane Austen”, you’re quicker than me). The four authors have previously done an anthology called “At the Duke’s Wedding”. (I guess they didn’t like the name “At Duke’s Wedding”).<br />
– These are pretty good samplers to get a taste for how each author writes, I reckon. Since reading AtDW, I’ve read at least one novel from each of the authors.</p>
<p>Anyway. Wasn’t a big fan of KAshe’s part of AtBW.<br />
The cool thing about the novella is it’s an “interpretation”/rendition/render of “Pride and Prejudice”. (Written by Jane Austen so it’s kindof meta, ha..). [I reckon Austen hates people more than KAshe does, so, that’s one limitation]. I dunno. Considering how much of a well-loved classic P&amp;P is, I’d say it’s more audacious to do something like this as opposed to otherwise rewriting/remixing types/tropes. – I didn’t enjoy it. Your Mileage May Vary.</p>
<p>Probably a big part of why I didn’t like it was the shrill, heavy-handed advocacy of Social Justice: The heroine suffers all sorts of woes. As far as I recall: crappy job, rape-y boss, other sexual discrimination, poor, sick sister who depends on her, abusive father. – I think that’s an album or two of country music right there. – But, also, naturally the heroine is a righteous-as-hell activist and woe the world is so evil and all.<br />
– With Heroines like Penelope Featherington (even in “Offer from a Gentleman”) or Evie from “Devil in Winter” or Annabelle Swift in “Seducing Mr. Knightly”, I can’t help but want to hug these women and protect them, etc.; here I felt none of that. :/</p>
<p>In terms of “internal”/“external” conflict, this character has zero room for character growth (unless the writer thinks that the character sounds like a twat. I think this author doesn’t think that the character sounds like a twat). ALL the conflict is external; all the conflict the character suffers are due to other people, or things outside the character.<br />
Flat, boring characters can be fine, even as main characters. But it’s kindof dull in a genre filled with strong characters. (People who complain about a lack of strong female characters surely haven’t read Romance Novels recently).</p>
<p>The Hero character in the story is similarly developed: the Hero is rich, handsome as anything, a super good lover; moreover, is deeply, totally in love with the heroine, and completely agrees with her on every moral/activist issue.<br />
– I feel there’s not a lot of potential for conflict here.<br />
The Hero expresses his love by following the heroine around and secretly funding her project and not talking to her or anything. But it’s totally not creepy. Because.<br />
Anyway. The Hero also works at his father’s company, which is big and evil and corporate and stuff. His father also is arrogant and evil and corporate and stuff. – I suppose it’d be a spoiler to say whether or not the Hero leaves this company by the end (as a token of his love?) of the novella? I’d better not spoil it, then.</p>
<p>Again. There’s zero room for “internal conflict” (and as per the model) character growth here.<br />
It’s like a “prince comes to rescue the princess” story, where both prince/princess characters are flat. cf. “Lord of Scoundrels”, wherein the prince is the Heroine, who “sees value/treasure in things everyone else overlooks”; and the princess trapped in a castle. LoS has the princess do at least some of the work to rescue himself (after a large amount of effort from the prince). i.e. maybe the prince doesn’t grow as a character much, but it’s a helluvan interesting princess.</p>
<p>Where the novella does present conflict is every time the Hero professes “I wuv you lots” the heroine has the angst of “obviously he’ll get bored of me eventually” (a classic trope, fair enough), as well as “my mum loved my dad but then that turned bad”. (And, of course, since the Hero works at big bad company, prejudice says that he must be big and bad. – thus the “prejudice” in “P&amp;P”.).<br />
Hurrah! The “parental issues” totally counts for this whole “internal conflict” the character needs to overcome. (Like, hey, if all you’ve known tells you to distrust a situation, how d’you overcome that?).<br />
As far as I recall, though, the resolution involves the Hero leaving his job and the heroine deciding “ok, I’ll date you.”. I can’t help but feel that one party is giving more to a compromise than the other. – “Okay, I’ll date the handsome/sexy/rich guy who agrees with everything I say” doesn’t feel like a prominent character development, in any case.</p>
<p>Maybe some of this is forgivable for the narrative being a novella. It’s surely more difficult for a novella to have solid characters than a full novel. – I completely adored KAshe’s novella “Kisses, She Wrote”, though; even characters who were given less than a page. So it’s neither the author nor the format at issue here. – And I guess different people are after different things. P&amp;P has enough in it such that people get different things out of it.<br />
Clearly the shoe “lack of internal conflict = boring characters” seems to fit; it’s not clear, though, that the story would obviously be better with whatever “internal conflict”. (Easy fix may be a “I would love the Hero but..”; e.g. ugly Hero [“I’d love him but he’s ugly”], arrogant Hero [“I’d love him but he’s arrogant”], etc.).<br />
And maybe even if the characters are awfully constructed, that the romance is ‘solid’ is nice anyway.</p>
<p>But for characters which aren’t flat, have growth &amp; conflict to resolve, it’s the “internal conflict = not bad character” model seems to work well enough for the Romance Novels as for the action/adventure stories.</p>

</div>

<p>So. Recently I re-read Lisa Kleypas’ “Devil in Winter”.<br />
Not the first time I’ve re-read that book.</p>
<p>There are some less-than-stellar parts of the book. (Notably, an awkward sequel-setup, which then doesn’t get follow-through in the next book besides “oh. that. haha. oops.”.).<br />
But it’s such an amazing, fantastic book! I can’t believe there’re those who don’t think it a 5-outta-5.</p>
<p>It really puts in the punches, constantly chapter-to-chapter the characters grow and interact and fight and flirt.<br />
Presumably you’ve read it if you’re reading this?<br />
I’m not sure I could summarise DiW well. I’m writing this post because I love the book.<br />
I will say there’re so many moments I love in the book!</p>
<p>– In the first chapter. When Sebastian insults Eva, and notices she doesn’t flinch at all. (What kindof upbringing would harden her to that?).<br />
When Sebastian takes care of her on the arduous ride.<br />
The wedding ceremony.<br />
Evie’s concern for her husband when he’s in a fight! Evie’s jealousy of her husband! Sebastian’s jealousy of Evie!<br />
When Sebastian’s wounded on the floor, Evie embrace. :’)<br />
When they’re in the office, Sebastian’s familiar intimacies with his wife.<br />
Sebastian coming into his own, putting his otherwise misdirected skills to good use.</p>
<p>And while I’ve re-read it many times, I still find it hard to put down when I pick it up.</p>
