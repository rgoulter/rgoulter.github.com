<p>I understand ‘Hate-Reading’ to mean reading something prejudicially / with fore-knowledge that you’re going to dislike it.<br />
You’re not reading it to build-bridges, but to bolster your own attitudes; you’re picking an example of what is condemnable about some group/idea you don’t like, and laughing at it in a “hey, look how <em>stupid</em> this is” kind of way.<br />
Certainly, in terms of rhetoric, saying <em>“look at <em>X</em>, can you <em>believe</em> anyone thinks that?”</em> is a great way to give the impression of stupidity to anyone who does think <em>X</em> isn’t such a bad idea.<br />
– So while I’m not unaware this isn’t constructive, allow me to. - If we <em>do</em> want to be constructive, we ought to try to interpret ‘the best’ out of the piece, rather than just pointing out all that’s wrong with it.</p>
<p>With that out of the way,<br />
this showed up on my timeline:<br />
<a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/music-theatre/2015/09/ryan-adams-s-1989-and-mansplaining-taylor-swift">“Ryan Adams’s 1989 and the mansplaining of Taylor Swift”</a>.<br />
I just know this is gonna be a good one.</p>
<p>The title. The goddamn <em>title</em> includes the word ‘mansplaining’.<br />
If you read through the rest of the article, you’ll also find the keywords: ‘gendered’, ‘appropriated’, ‘patriarchal’, ‘man-baby’.<br />
It even links to <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/in-her-response-to-nicki-minaj-taylor-swift-has-just-proved-how-shes-white-feminisms-off-beat-bambi-10408320.html">some article pointing out Swift is the patronus of ‘white feminism’</a> (with regards to Swift’s reply to Nicki Minaj).<br />
I’m astounded that the author didn’t use the words ‘straight white male’, also.</p>
<p>To <em>try</em> and be constructive, the opening paragraph at least seems to understand the situation the article describes: ‘not liking pop/mainstream music’ is ‘cool’, and ‘Adams is more indie than Swift’, modus ponens. – <em>That</em> much does make sense, and sufficiently explains what’s going on.<br />
Author’s suggestion of “takes vibrant pop music and makes it blandly meloncholic in an indie way” sounds like it’s accurate, also.<br />
But the author then goes on to point out, rather than this being “media loving ‘indie’ artist covering ‘mainstream’ artist’s music”, it’s instead “media loving ‘male’ artist covering ‘female’ artist’s music”. (For what it’s worth, I’ve not heard of Adams. Presumably he’s popular. And as lazy as “if the genders were swapped” is, I can totally see any author that would use the word ‘mansplaining’ would also see ‘sexism’ in having-heard-of a mainstream male artist &amp; not an indie female artist).</p>
<p>But <em>are</em> the other sites all positive?<br />
A quick search shows <a href="http://mic.com/articles/123530/ryan-adams-is-covering-taylor-swift-s-entire-1989-in-the-style-of-the-smiths">Mic</a>, <a href="http://themuse.jezebel.com/ryan-adams-full-rerecording-of-taylor-swifts-1989-is-he-1732084233">Jezebel</a> both 1) like the album well enough and 2) point out that Swift enthusiastically endorses the idea. – I mean, if <em>Jezebel</em> isn’t ‘calling out’ the sexism of it, right?<br />
– Oh, wait, <a href="http://www.themarysue.com/taylor-swift-and-ryan-adams-respect-for-the-feminine/">The Mary Sue</a> takes the same stance as OP. “people hate pop + idolise indie … which equals gendered sexism” or so. - The Mary Sue goes one further and points out ‘feminine’ things aren’t taken seriously. (Mary Sue then links to some call-out on The Guardian. Oh, internet, don’t stop being so reliable).</p>
<p>– The newstatesman piece also suggests that this instance of ‘mansplaining’ evokes other instances (a woman’s joke not being found funny, only to be laughed at when a man says it; a woman’s idea not being endorsed only to have it be a good idea when a man says it); but given the indie-is-cool dynamic going on, author really does seem to be crying wolf. (If clearly Swift herself likes music, but Adams’ covering it is sexist, then</p>
<p>That said, while I don’t particularly doubt the author’s sincerity in their writing,<br />
at ‘best’ this kind of reaching comes about from some ‘quest to find sexism under every rock’ or so; like wearing shit-tainted glasses.<br />
More cynically, this kind of sexism-under-every-rock garners clicks from 1) people who strive to call out sexism 2) people annoyed at the ‘cry wolf’ call outs. – And since the passionate in either of these groups are likely to dislike the other, it’s likely to be shared emphatically.<br />
And have people write about it on their blog.</p>
<p>Or it could be something else entirely: an indie-lover who sees that some music is ‘too mainstream’. (And liking Swift’s mainstream music is a non-mainstream opinion). – But the idea of something as .. uninspiring as an album review trying to stir shit is fun.</p>

    <title>Harnessing the Outrage Machine</title>

</div>

<p>South Park’s S19E1 episode, introducing the ‘PC Principal’, seemed to have upset some people. (e.g. <a href="https://twitter.com/thewtfmagazine/status/644391652354879488">this tweet</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/94_jasy/status/645026598488555520">this tweet</a>.<br />
– For what it’s worth, the episode doesn’t say ‘political correctness is bad’, nor ‘social justice is bad’, and it certainly isn’t pandering to say these things are great. - The episode clearly attacks the disproportionate, abusive, bullying endorsed by the “social justice bullies” (as <a href="https://medium.com/@aristoNYC/social-justice-bullies-the-authoritarianism-of-millennial-social-justice-6bdb5ad3c9d3">aristoNYC’s piece</a> termed it).<br />
The term “Social Justice Warrior” is itself.. fun, since many who endorse its characteristics don’t see it as pejorative: ‘Warrior for Social Justice? How could that be a bad thing?’. (Even aristoNYC’s piece, a pretty good article criticising SJWs, likes the term. Thus, “SJ Bullies”).<br />
– South Parks’ contribution to the lexicon here is ‘great’: <a href="https://twitter.com/SouthPark/status/644377482129371136">“You PC bro?”</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/SouthPark/status/644377056021602304">“It’s not BRUCE fucking Jenner, it’s Caitlyn and she’s a fucking stunning woman!”</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/SouthPark/status/644331288426483713">“WOO WOO WOO! You hear that!? That’s the sound of 2015 pulling you over people!”</a> are all sure to be copy-pasted over as height-of-wit when people see someone being a bully. (I do like that last one, it captures the tone of ‘call out’ amazingly well).</p>
<p>Prominent YouTube account GameTheory recently released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPpBlDaKM_o">this video</a>, pointing out that when the media calls gamers “12 year old losers”, it garners a reaction of outrage. (e.g. Jimmy Kimmell managed to get 3x videos in a row, with very little creativity, each getting more views than his channel usually gets, just calling gamers “12 year old losers”).<br />
The video also features the cliche quote of “first they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they fight you, then you win” or so. YMMV.<br />
– But the interesting part of the video was from ~10:30ff, when it was pointed out media sensationalism over ‘shark attacks’ were able to create widespread fear of sharks. Such a fear is irrational and unfounded. Another example it pointed out was the media as the chief culprit of the downfall-into-obscurity of some presidential candidate. – I’m not sure how accurate these examples are of how powerful the media can be, but “media’s lens on insignificant issues has an impact on public perception” is somewhat disconcerting.</p>
<p>Surely there’s room for some level of introspection, to be able to say “hey, I’m outraged by this.” then “does it matter?”, and calm down or so?</p>
<p>I’m not quite talking about <a href="https://medium.com/@julien/the-complete-guide-to-not-giving-a-fuck-52bc4be9e7c1">“not giving a fuck”</a>.<br />
– Certainly “let’s ignore all negative feedback, because there’s NOTHING I can do about it” sounds like a terrible idea. (It’s not what the author <em>means</em>, but it’s a conclusion which could be <em>read</em> from it all the same).</p>
<p>– For what it’s worth, I also think “calming down” by way of cat pictures &amp; other cute things in between bouts of outrage seems a technique to make ‘online bezerkers’: if the outrage is never discussed-through, doesn’t that make it easier to increase tensions?</p>
<p>Anyway.<br />
It seems to me some of the common ways to get an affiliate (of whatever) enraged at a speaker/article:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Unflattering misrepresentation</li>
<li>Unflattering accurate representation</li>
<li>Unflattering reality (for the affiliate)</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m just pulling this out of my ass, so. (Another good way to get an affiliate aroused is some anecdote/story which supports their view of reality: “something bad happened, but if people like me were in charge, it wouldn’t have happened”).<br />
– ‘Being outraged’ is not a particularly sensible response to <em>any</em> of these things. But I suppose if they ‘hurt’ you, you gotta ‘hurt’ them back, right?</p>
<p>– Since being abstract is awful, let me try the above in the context of the South Park episode: it’s upsetting to fans of Social Justice that the ‘PC Bros’ are the ‘bad guys’ (unflatting misrepresentation of ‘social justice’), but also hits close-to-home the vicious nature of SJ bullying online (unflattering accurate representation). – I’ve also seen comments along the lines of how ‘transphobic’ the episode was; perhaps the bullies find it upsetting that not everyone things Jenner is a hero?</p>
<p>Issues which polarise are polarising further than they have before, it seems to me.</p>

    <title>Thoughts on Facebook Dislike Button</title>

</div>

<p>So, recently it hit my newsfeed that Facebook was working on a ‘dislike button’.<br />
Except it’s <em>not</em> going to be a ‘dislike’ button, so much as a ‘condolences’ button; for giving one’s regards if a post isn’t appropriate to ‘like’.<br />
– This subtlety didn’t particularly reach the many who failed to read past a headline title. (That is, pretty much everyone on my newsfeed who shared it).<br />
Which leads to reactions like “finally” or “about time” from some,<br />
and from the gentler parts of the internet reactions like “oh no, the <em>trolls</em> are going to ruin Facebook!”.</p>
<p>It’s a little frustrating.</p>
<p>“<em>finally</em>” is a classic reaction to this; I’m pretty sure I’ve seen “if only Facebook had a dislike button” snark from the time I started using Facebook.<br />
But Facebook doesn’t exactly work that way.<br />
You’re ‘friends’ with the people on Facebook, with some kind of connection to the contacts In-Real-Life. That’s quite different to other online sites where you can upvote/downvote posts. – It’s reasonable to ‘like’, or to comment “I love this!” for posts you like, much less reasonable to leave a comment “who cares?” or “you’re stupid” for content you don’t like.</p>
<p>Those concerned about “<em>trolls</em>” or about filling the site with negativity are also misguided. (I mean, even if they were right about it being a “dislike” button).<br />
Partly because friend-to-friend ‘dislikes’ wouldn’t be all that high (though, say, advertising posts or posts on unpopular brands would get quite ‘disliked’).<br />
But also, even the idea of trying to construct a filtered community, constrained in thought by the linguistic allowances of Facebook just sounds really concerning to me. (Let’s not say “bad”, let’s say “double plus un-good”, anyone?).<br />
– Fortunately, <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/mark_forsyth_what_s_a_snollygoster_a_short_lesson_in_political_speak">the words we speak don’t shape reality</a> (it’s the other way around), but the desire is still unsettling. (Although, admittedly, that’s getting rather alarmist about Facebook, as well as making an Orwell analogy, so, whatever).</p>
<p>But the problem of ‘people not being nice to each other’ isn’t only present in (nor encouraged by) forums which feature dislike buttons, and other negative feedback.<br />
– Both Facebook and Twitter are vaguely similar in feedback mechanisms: a post/tweet can be liked/favourited, or replied-to, or shared. These are all “constructive”, positive things. The ‘negative’ feedback for each is more passive: you can unfollow/mute an account you don’t like, or you can unfriend/block an account you really don’t like, but these indications aren’t explicit on a newsfeed/timeline. – Facebook/Twitter differ in terms of visibility of posts: Facebook’s profiles are private-by-default, Twitter’s are public-by-default. This affects discussion.<br />
The point, is, though, even absent of ‘negative’ feedback like a ‘dislike’ button, these social media sites are <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/jon_ronson_what_happens_when_online_shaming_spirals_out_of_control">capable of awful harassment</a>. People see something they don’t like, it angers them, people share it with their network, who then also get angry and share it, etc.<br />
– Online shaming is awful, it’s people treating other people like they’re not people, and its presence isn’t dictated by a fucking ‘dislike’ button.</p>
<p>Worse, though, is that.. even short of ‘online shaming’, there’s nothing amazing about users of social media only being in a network with people whom they like.<br />
It’s remarkable, concerning to see <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/view/539856/this-is-what-controversies-look-like-in-the-twittersphere/">what controversies on Twitter look like</a>. (Hint: They’re the ones where people on each side of the discussion only interact with the people who agree with them, and there’s little discussion between each side).<br />
I’m a big fan of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b86dzTFJbkc">Jonathon Haidt’s talk here</a>, discussing is ‘Righteous Mind’ book. And my thinking is, if people limit their interaction online to those they like, you won’t have folk who only share posts from Fox news being ‘friends’ with folk who only share their posts from Al-Jazeera America (or whatever). – And emphasis on “warm, fuzzy, no negativity” is more likely to lend to a close-minded, homogeneous community than a community which people disagree with each other.</p>
<p>Doom &amp; gloom aside, is there a way to have some discussion forum which’d encourage diversity, encourage people to be able to respectfully disagree with one another?<br />
Because I can’t think up incentive for folk to visit a site for people to tell each other “hey, you’re wrong about whatever”.</p>

<p>It’d be nice if we could raise the level of public discourse.<br />
Or, rather, can we talk to each other less stupidly? D’you think it’s reasonable that we can come together and talk about complicated issues without treating the people we disagree with as idiots?</p>
<p>– Is there a country wherein political discussions are exchanges/arguments of the best ideas from different perspectives; wherein it’s not automatically assumed that those disagreeing are idiots/imbeciles?<br />
If not, I probably shouldn’t complain about how people discuss politics in whatever country. Such discussions are fated to be shit.<br />
But a man can dream.<br />
And for now, surely it’s not too much to be annoyed at seeing shit-flinging on my social media newsfeeds.</p>
<p>I don’t hope for everyone to go around using big poncy words. I rather hope everyone doesn’t.<br />
I also don’t hope for discussion to descent to pedantic finger-pointing out of “logical fallacy!”.</p>
<p>But how bad does your political viewpoint have to be for you to see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt">FUD tactics</a> as a reasonable way to argue?</p>
<p>I wouldn’t mind all this so much if the foolery were settled on one side,<br />
(Or if I weren’t Facebook-friends with these kindof people, damnit),<br />
but wouldn’t some “marketplace of ideas”, to misuse the analogy, be better off if I wanted to buy from everyone selling?</p>
<p>– There’s a reason why pictures of cats (or funny posts about Harry Potter) aren’t so annoying. You’re unlikely to sound like you’ve no clue what you’re speaking about when you share pictures of cats. (Though, speaking about … these things people get righteously uppity about … it ain’t so).<br />
It’s also much harder to be funny or snarky in an elegant way than people tend to think. Most of what counts as “satire” is someone mocking a mis-representation of their opponents viewpoint. – Which is great if you think “ha, they’re calling the people I don’t like stupid/wrong” is a good form of humour, but insufferable otherwise.</p>
<p>Also, yes, merely discussing how people discuss these things, over just discussing ‘these things’ isn’t necessarily any more fun, and can probably also fall into righteous hob-nobbery, but oh well.</p>

    <title>Watching Videogames</title>

<p>I kinda think action movies are boring.<br />
I recently watched Fast &amp; Furious 7. I loved it! It wasn’t as quite as stupid or bad as I’d heard it might be. It was good fun, despite being more “Furious” (gunplay/fights) than “Fast” (cars &amp; such). – But despite my love for the absurdly-cool Saturday-morning-cartoon-ish idea of a bus which has 3x automatic miniguns coming from hidden panels.. the plot constrains expectations: the bad guy will be amazingly powerful and untouchable at the start, until the climax, where the good guys will beat the odds and save the day.<br />
I feel the same way about the good parts of Salvatore’s fantasy novels: the violence &amp; action is fun in itself, and the whole “good guy vs bad guy” traditional arc is satisfying.. but kinda ‘boring’ in that it’s extremely hard to make tension/suspense when the outcome is set.</p>
<p>Action <em>videogames</em>, on the other hand, don’t <em>exactly</em> suffer this. - In terms of <em>plot</em>, maybe, since outside of ‘RPGs’, the plot is going to be pretty much the same. So, “good guy wins, bad guy loses” holds true.<br />
But with <em>videogames</em>, there’s no guarantee the player gets to see the whole plot: if you can’t play the game well enough, you don’t get to complete the story. – It’s for things like that why gamers are probably more passionate about things than readers.</p>
<p>But even the hobby of <em>watching</em> videogames <a href="http://blog.semilshah.com/2015/08/23/the-confluence-of-trends-making-esports-go-mainstream/">is becoming more popular these days</a>.<br />
– This is quite understandable with eSports - you can watch people who are very good at a game (whether you understand the game or not), and there’s no reason why this’d be any less fun to watch than sports which demand athleticism.<br />
This also makes sense to watch someone play through a game you can’t play yourself, if you don’t have the console it’s on, or don’t have the money to play.. e.g. I can understand people watching playthroughs of GTA:V if they don’t have a console.<br />
– Or if the game is too scary (or hard, or require too much investment of time to learn); I’d watch a playthrough of someone playing “Outlast”, but wouldn’t play it myself. – The streamer’s reactions can be fun.<br />
And, yeah, it can be entertaining to watch people like Rooster Teeth’s Achievement Hunters, or Yogscast Sips play through games.</p>
<p>What I feel makes no sense is watching someone play a game you could play yourself.<br />
– Besides being passionate about games, the other thing about gamers is their tenacity.. it’s good for games to be a bit challenging. Gamers have the cliche that if you’re fighting bad guys / struggles, then you know you’re on the right path. And by <em>watching</em>, you miss out on that.</p>
<p>– That said, I’m happy enough to play Call of Duty campaigns. It’s popular to hate on CoD as garbage. Certainly the campaigns have always been .. loud, and with enough gunplay and stupid action to make F&amp;F7 look like a case study of physics. – It’d be fair to call CoD “boring”. (If everything in the game is explosions and gunfire, there’s no contrast for the narrative to be able to emphasise any particular part as dangerous or impressive.). But like action movies, it can be fun, too.</p>

<p>Windows 10 has been pretty great so far.</p>
<p>WHY HAS NO ONE MENTIONED WORKSPACES?<br />
I always heard Windows 10 hyped up as a marriage of Windows 8 and Windows 7. Sure, I heard that Win 10 was going to have a ‘package manager’, just-like-Linux, but no one mentioned the workspaces.<br />
Sure, I still don’t know the shortcut keys. <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2014/10/03/keyboard-shortcuts-in-the-windows-10-technical-preview/">Apparently</a> it’s <code>Win + Ctrl + Left/Right</code> to switch desktop. – Other keyboard shortcuts I wish I knew were “Move window to left/right desktop”, and for when I’m lucky enough to have multiple monitors, “Move window to left/right display”.<br />
Scott Hansleman <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/Windows10GetsAFreshCommandPromptAndLotsOfHotkeys.aspx">goes over command prompt hotkeys</a>, also, which is nice.</p>
<p>Upgrade process? Well, for me, I did a fresh install of Win 8.1 Pro, then directly upgraded to Win 10 via the Windows Update.. doing that works really well. (“fresh install”, though.). And on my lab machine, I did a fresh install of Win 10 Education edition. (Which I blame for breaking my Linux installation, though I did play a bit with EasyBCD, so might be PEBKAC).</p>
<p>But the things that annoyed me most:</p>
<h2 id="family-settings">Family Settings</h2>

    Posted on August 18, 2015
    
        by Richard Goulter
    <br/>
    
    Tags: <a href="/tags/rumination.html">rumination</a>, <a href="/tags/cs3216.html">cs3216</a>, <a href="/tags/elitism.html">elitism</a>
    
</div>

<p>It’s been a year since I took CS3216 at NUS.<br />
It’s quite a fun course, working on web app technologies. (For context of those who aren’t aware, almost all the coursework involves teamwork, and entry to the course is by-way-of application.).</p>
<p>– I want to reflect on <a href="http://blog.nus.edu.sg/cs3216rgoulter/2014/09/06/reflection-on-assignment-1/">one of the blogposts I wrote</a>; but to say “hey, what I wrote was great” is awful. The blogpost was warts-and-all, though, so let me reflect on it a bit..</p>
<p>(NOTE 2015/08/22: enough people I showed <em>the</em> post to liked it; I was told by a labmate I was famous for my blog [which I sincerely doubt], which I figure to mean the blogpost I’m hand-wringing over here..)</p>
<h2 id="cs3216-the-elite">CS3216 the Elite</h2>
<p>– Complaints over the exclusive nature of entry into CS3216 made their way onto NUSWhispers; these complaints were met with contempt or ridicule.<br />
(The worst of the complaints being a notion of “CS3216 is for smart/great kids; if I get in I’ll be able to be smart/great.”. – I mean, if you tell students “this class is for smart students, but you’re not invited”, what the fuck d’you expect students to feel?).<br />
The justification given by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/ben-leong/on-cs3216cs3217-and-elitism/10153053255577549">Prof Ben Leong</a> seems to be along the lines of “CS3216/7 lets top-tier students come together and make cool stuff”. This would make sense if every student in 3216/7 were top-tier, and 3216/7 evinced a nature of incubating quality projects (i.e. projects which live on after semester’s end.). – The latter doesn’t happen; and I’ve reason to doubt that everyone who gets into 3216/7 is “top tier”..<br />
Anyway, <a href="http://nuswhispers.com/tag/5641">Beng’s post</a> is much better. (Beng is, somewhat famously, the creator of NUSMods, which is used by pretty much every NUS student to plan their timetables.). Beng’s post points out he wasn’t born amazing, and worked hard to get to where he wanted. But what I like most about it, – and where Prof Leong’s post also agrees with this – is the idea of doing work outside of school to improve one’s skill.</p>
<p>What I would add/emphasise, though, is that.., like. While “getting work done”, and being industrious are fine virtues, I reckon when it comes to programming, this should be a matter of interest: play around with C++11, because building things “natively” is fun, and so then you can be the guy who knows C++ on the team. Play around with some non-Java JVM language, like Scala or Clojure, because these things are more fun to program than Java. Learn one of Haskell or Erlang, because their not-C/Java/Python nature makes them fascinating to a student who otherwise won’t encounter them in coursework. Learn your way around a terminal, because working in a full-screen terminal looks cool-as-shit and like leet-hacker-skills. etc. etc. – I mean, obviously not <em>all</em> of these things; obviously not <em>all</em> at once.</p>
<h2 id="git">Git</h2>
<p><a href="../../posts/programming/2014-04-26-online-resources-for-git.html">I wish everyone knew git better</a>.</p>
<p>During 3216, I had a teammate who “didn’t know git”, and in a reflection blogpost <a href="http://blog.nus.edu.sg/cs3216rgoulter/2014/09/06/reflection-on-assignment-1/">I complained about that</a>.<br />
The truth of the matter is more complicated than the guy “didn’t know git”; his incompetencies were far broader than that. And there were worse things than that post complains about. But, anyway. (Said guy was <em>in his final year of a CS degree</em> at this time. Managed to graduate with “honours”, also. And is now working at a bank prob’ly earning much more money than me. I’m not sure what the moral of the story is there.).</p>
<p>I hadn’t read that blogpost since writing it.<br />
I was quite surprised to see it wasn’t as whiney as I recalled. (There’s still a lot of whining; just not as much as I recalled.).<br />
It’s not all bad. Roughly, it goes over:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The “renaissance” programmer: not just good at coding, but also at living “the good life”; improving himself, e.g. also in areas of communicating with others, and health/wellbeing.</p></li>
<li><p>Code examples of a top-tier 3216/7 student; including merge conflicts pushed to master. (This is what the blogpost was written for.).</p></li>
<li><p>‘How am I supposed to feel about that?’.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tone">Tone</h2>
<p>I’m split about the tone.</p>
<p>There’s some self-chastisement; but it’s all in terms of “I’m being a jerk” and “I wish I were a better man”, and not in terms of “if my team sucked, it’s because I didn’t take more responsibility”. – The whole “sorry to be a dick” and then being a dick is the lamest part. (On further thought, the bitterness here takes the sarcasm to another level.).</p>
<p>But I also admire some of the anger; there’s at least anger at the “3216 is for talented kids” pitch. (It’s awful for someone to kiss their own ass, right; but, hey, if I’m criticising myself, only fair for me to like some things, too.).</p>
<p>– Where I’m most ambivalent is about the anger shown at incompetency.<br />
At worst, being angry at someone’s incompetence potentially has the childishness of incredulity at someone not knowing something obscure. It’s unhelpful to be angry at people for something they needn’t have known, and unwelcoming. People inherently deserve to be treated with respect, even if they’re incompetent.<br />
On the other hand, it’s outright surprising that a final year Computer Science student wouldn’t know (or wouldn’t even learn basic) Git/VCS, let alone someone taking an ‘elite’ course. (NUS’ degree required taking software engineering courses, which teach that, so this isn’t the case of “well, computer science doesn’t necessarily involve programming.”.). – Moreover, in a course which by its nature demands quickly learning new skills/concepts (web app dev for people who haven’t done web app dev before), it’s disappointing, perhaps disrespectful, to not learn basics of what you’re working on.<br />
<em>Frustration</em> is at least understandable, in any case.</p>
<p>(EDIT 2015/08/22: I think it’s rare, really rare, to find people who can mediate situations really well. And confronting people is hard. What I wish in general is that it’d be much easier to applaud and admire mediation than to admire posts where someone gets angry at someone who does stupid shit.).</p>
<h2 id="excellence">Excellence</h2>
<p>What I didn’t remember from the blogpost was the notion of “pursuing excellence”.<br />
Not sure the term “renaissance programmer” is widely used, but then as now I like the idea of someone who pursues excellence in understanding the tools of their craft; pursues excellence in how to otherwise be efficient at their craft (e.g. good health, good communication skills).<br />
I think this is where I link to that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGFf3SRP1bE">Bruce Lee video, ‘Be Water My Friend’</a>.</p>
<p>I’m inclined to say anyone who spends a blogpost complaining about the incompetencies of their teammates has further to go to reach such excellence..</p>
<p>Probably also one man’s “excellence” is another person’s “competent”, I’d guess. – With Vim, say, it’s a <a href="../../posts/programming/2014-04-26-tools.html">process of continually learning</a> about commands you’ve not heard of before, and noting how to improve on that.<br />
Surely a healthy, helpful attitude to have. :-)</p>

</div>

<h2 id="preamble-bullying-is-bad-try-telling-the-bullies-that">Preamble (Bullying is Bad, Try Telling the Bullies That)</h2>
<p>Amazon and GoodReads are both prominent places to review books. – My Humble Opinion is to prefer GoodReads, since I don’t use Kindle.</p>
<p>I’ve written before about GoodReads: <a href="../../posts/romance/2014-03-08-paradox-of-fandom.html">Wondering</a> if people who read books more were less impressed by good books than people who weren’t as well read; and looking at <a href="../../posts/romance/2014-07-16-readers-and-lists-on-goodreads.html">GoodReads’ lists</a>, remarking hwo snobbish some of the lists were. (Guess which books came under “didn’t finish”, “most hated”?).</p>
<p>So. Recently there’s been <a href="../../posts/romance/2015-08-09-open-letter-regarding-kate-breslins-for-such-a-time-and-diversity-in-romance.html">some controversy</a> in romancelandia.<br />
A quick glance at the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18008080-for-such-a-time?from_search=true&amp;search_version=service_impr">GoodReads page</a> for the book shows the reviews filled with at least a dozen 1-star reviews written since August (i.e. after Wendell’s letter.). <em>Many of which even openly admit to not having read the book</em>. – I don’t care how righteous your cause: if you review books as 1-star, <em>without having read the book</em>, you’re a bully.<br />
– Fortunately, at the time of writing the book still has an average of 3.9/5, which is at least par for “really good book”, and about as high as many authors (in the romance genre, at least) are able to achieve. (And somewhat higher than the more mainstream unpopular books.).<br />
– Counterpoint: What about if you borrow a book from a friend, read 1 page, then 1-star it; would that still be bullying? I do think “hate reading” is a thing: reading something knowing you’re going to hate it. Surely you’ve got to be pretty bitter to do <em>that</em>. – But even more simply, if you’re going into a book with that much prejudice.. I think you misunderstand the point of “books let you understand different viewpoints.”.</p>
<p>More importantly: does your giving a 1-star review benefit the community? Is it constructive to the community?<br />
Of course I think there’s room for people to give 1-star reviews. The usual expectation is that they’ve read the book.</p>
<p>– Maybe worth noting is I couldn’t find this book by searching for its title. It’s unclear whether the name was too obscure, there’s a bug in the algorithm/index, the book was unlisted automatically for receiving 1-star reviews(?), the book was unlisted on request (for being too hateful, or for being a target of hate). Or it could just be me.</p>
<h2 id="questions-can-reviews-tell-us-anything">Questions; Can Reviews Tell Us Anything?</h2>
<p>In any case. It would be fascinating to visualise some of this stuff.<br />
Numbers don’t lie. (Interpretation of numbers does, but that’s a different issue.).</p>
<p>But, I mean, I’m not just curious about this controversy. Things I’d love to see:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What has the average rating of this book been over time? Per number of reviews? What has the number of 5-star, 1-star reviews been over time?</p></li>
<li><p>What has the average rating been for other RITA nominations, from publication to nomination, from nomination to awards, and after the awards?<br />
 <em>Compared to previous years, this would offer a control of what a typical RITA nomination looks like. Oh, comparing to a non-RITA book may be interesting too.</em><br />
 <em>“For Such a Time” is somewhat controversial. Is the data for “For Such a Time” different in an interesting way to show this? (Could you know, given reviews of a book, whether it’s similarly “controversial”?).</em></p></li>
<li><p>Does a reviewer’s “average rating” (the average of the ratings they’ve given) follow a trend over time / over the number of books read?<br />
 <em>I would think it tends toward 3 or 4 over time.</em><br />
 <em>How similar would this be between readers?</em><br />
 <em>If some books do gain controversial attention, do the people giving 1-star, 5-star reviews share similar traits? (e.g. number of books read, average rating.).</em><br />
 <em>If some books do get extreme reviews (1-star, 5-star) from controversial attention, how anomalous does this look per the reviewer?</em></p></li>
<li><p>What percentage of a books reviews are read by “fans”?<br />
 <em>Are books reviews at all by ‘fans’? (e.g. people who liked other books from the same author.).</em> <em>How consistent are authors? (If readers liked some authors book, is there a likelihood that a large proportion of readers will rate the books consistently?).</em></p></li>
<li><p>Does the distribution of 1-5 star ratings for a book follow a trend over time?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>…Do these things vary by genre? (Clearly I care only about Romance Novels here; and even then only some sub-genres.).<br />
I’m not saying these questions are well-formed or anything. (And I clearly have suspicions about some things). But it’d be interesting to see some data related to this. (Though, if you have better questions, I would be interested to hear them.).</p>
<p>Trying my best, I think those who I disagree with might be curious about things like:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Is there any association between words used in the blurb (hinting at content) and average rating, 1-star, 5-star ratings? <em>Rationale would be, books with unpleasant content get more 1-star reviews.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Do 1-star, 5-star reviewers tend to make use of the same words as each other?</p></li>
</ul>

    <title>Tabs vs Spaces and Elastic Tabs</title>

    Tags: <a href="/tags/tabs%20vs%20spaces.html">tabs vs spaces</a>, <a href="/tags/elastic%20tabs.html">elastic tabs</a>
    
</div>

<p>I was surprised to discover I’ve not written about “tabs vs spaces” before, despite all my love for writing about editors.</p>
<h2 id="whats-tabs-vs-spaces-all-about">What’s “Tabs vs Spaces” All About?</h2>
<p>The less something matters, the more programmers will argue over it. (No, not “bikeshedding”, which is similar, but doesn’t quite account for things like programmers arguing over different programming languages.).<br />
Grammarians are similar, I suppose.</p>
<p>The biggest part of this ‘holy war’ consists of people arguing over whether it’s better to indent with tabs or spaces. Roughly (and without any bias): if you indent with spaces, then you know that it anything aligned will still be aligned on another computer; <em>but</em>, people will have different preferences as to whether to indent with 2-spaces, 4-spaces, or some other size.<br />
Tabs let you change the size of indentation, so when using tabs to indent, people can set the tabwidth to how they prefer it. The chief downside to this is you can’t use tabs to <em>align</em> things, because aligning means you want certain characters to be in the same column, which fixes the tabwidth.</p>
<p>– The middle ground to this is often called “mixed”: use tabs for indentation, and spaces for alignment.</p>
<h3 id="practicality">Practicality</h3>
<p>There are some practical problems about this, too:<br />
Setting up “mixed” tabs/spaces in an editor isn’t as easy as only-spaces or only-tabs.<br />
Even using tabs-only can be messy, since it’s not always clear whether pressing the Tab key on a keyboard will insert spaces or a proper tab; so a poorly configured editor may insert spaces into what was previously a tabs-only file.<br />
Modern editors are pretty capable at treating ‘4-spaces’ as if they were a single indentation character: pressing a Tab key will insert 4 spaces, and pressing backspace will delete 4 spaces.</p>
<p>Working on teams, it’s important for everyone to follow the same code style.<br />
– I’ve heard stories of my friends where there was a sequence of commits which were purely for tabifying or untabifying the codebase.<br />
And, obviously, the diffs shown between these changes simply show “THE WHOLE FILE WAS DELETED, THE WHOLE FILE WAS CREATED.”.</p>
<h2 id="why-this-is-whole-thing-is-dumb">Why This is Whole Thing is Dumb</h2>
<p>One of these programming ‘holy wars’ is dumb? You don’t say!</p>
<p>But, still.<br />
HTML/CSS manages to separate <em>content</em> from <em>form</em>. - <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a> is a notable example of the <em>exact same content</em> being displayed very differently with different themes.<br />
– While <em>some</em> languages currently make use of whitespace/alignment as part of syntax (famously Python, jokingly whitespace, but also even things like Haskell [in places]), most don’t. – So, it’s kindof dumb that something which doesn’t affect content is treated as content by tools. (Well, tools like Git will offer to ignore whitespace changes in diffs; but, again, tools can be difficult to use.).<br />
For that to work, you’d have to have some program to decode from a neutral source file so that it’s displayed how a programmer likes in an editor (2-space indent or 4-space indent; braces aligned in the same column; spaces between declarations; etc. etc.), as well as some program to encode to the source file in a neutral layout. – This is just pie-in-the-sky, of course, and it’s not hard to come up with cases where this wouldn’t work. (e.g. comments, which the programmer may prefer not aligned relative to the syntax.).</p>
<h2 id="tabs-and-tabstops">Tabs and Tabstops</h2>
<p>But, *gasp*, I have been a little biased in my description:<br />
The simplest way to use tabs is strictly at the start of a line for indentation. If used in the middle of a line, different people/programs have different opinions as to whether the <em>correct</em> thing to do is to skip <em>tabwidth</em> spaces, or to align to the nearest 8th column.<br />
– To me this sounds stupid; when I was using org-mode, I noticed it used tabs after some text as a placeholder for spaces: Emacs insisted on tabwidth being 8, while a Vim plugin insisted on tabwidth being 6.</p>
<p>Yet, both of these are bastardisations of the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090615091848/http://www.nabble.com/-long--Re:-Elastic-tabstops-p20025677.html">“tabstop” as used by typewriters.</a>:<br />
The “tabstop” was a position set so than when pressing the ‘tab’ key, the paper would align to that point. This helped to write Tables. (TABle, TAB).</p>
<pre>
  Tab stop bar:   |------V-----------------V------|

  Typing:         Dear Sir,

<h2 id="elastic-tabstops">Elastic Tabstops</h2>
<p>I first saw mention of elastic tabstops on Neovim’s issues page.<br />
<a href="http://nickgravgaard.com/elastic-tabstops/">Elastic tabstops</a> are much closer in spirit to aforementioned typewriter tabstops.<br />
The GIF perhaps explains the concept best:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/7MsEnA9.gif" alt="" />

</div>
<p>Although, as far as “implementation”, it seems to just render current tab(s) differently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While editors which haven’t yet implemented the elastic tabstops mechanism may not align some text properly in files where tabs were used with elastic tabstops, the problem isn’t that bad. All leading tabs (indentation) will be okay, and the chances of text not aligning correctly diminishes as the width between tabstops increases. So if you plan on switching to elastic tabstops in the future, and wish to choose a code style with that in mind (to use now), I suggest using tabs with fixed tabstops every 8 characters (or more) across. Alternatively co-workers can use tabs with fixed tabstops of whatever size they like as long as no one tries to line up text for anything other than indentation.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="drawbacks">Drawbacks</h3>
<p>It seems the idea was conceived in 2006. It’s 2015. That said, Neovim is in theory going to be easier to contribute to than Vim. And it has already been implemented in some array of text-editors.. so the discipline isn’t impossible.</p>
<p>But this <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/137290/what-are-the-drawbacks-of-elastic-tabstops">StackExchange thread</a> makes some excellent points:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Personal preference</p></li>
<li><p>Technical implementation: It’s different to what most text editors have done, and isn’t widely available. This limits adoption.</p></li>
<li><p>Who cares?: Developers have done well enough as-is for the last however many years; people can set aside subjective disagreements if they <em>really</em> need to, anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>Impact: Compare the quote above; using leading tabs for indentation is pretty much the same behaviour as elastic tabstops; and the other adjustments aren’t all worth the novelty.</p></li>
<li><p>Corner cases: Considering the Python snippet:</p>
<pre><code>def foo( bar,
         xyzzy ):
    wibble()</code></pre>
<p>it’s probably something elastic tabstops will mess up, without code intelligence.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>– For what it’s worth, I still don’t see this as inherently more natural than the “mixed” solution.</p>
<p>Even so, it appears that elastic tabstops are the kind of thing which could be adopted into codebases iteratively. (I imagine this would look ugly for tools which don’t support elastic tabstops; but the same is true if a programmer assumes tabwidth to be a certain value anyway, so it’s not like the issue would be new.).</p>

<p>And they had to share a nomination slate with a Christian romance set in a concentration camp with a Nazi hero and a Jewish heroine who converts at the end. It finaled in two categories. TWO. And I have no freaking clue how. Was no one Jewish involved in the awards process? Do we really need, in this day and age, to have a Jewish person tell us that concentration camp romance is deeply fucked up? Shouldn’t that be, like, COMMON KNOWLEDGE?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="wendells-post">Wendell’s Post</h2>
<p>Wendell’s begins with an ostensibly much more neutral tone, although manages to share many of the same attitudes.<br />
Key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The nomination upset some people. Let’s try to discuss why.</li>
<li>Book was set in a concentration camp. The Holocaust was an awful part of human history.</li>
<li>The romance is set between a Nazi and a Jew; this is a pretty unhealthy imbalance of power.</li>
<li>The book is a retelling of Esther set in the Holocaust. The Nazi hero is redeemed in the end. The heroine converts to Christianity.</li>
<li>Redeeming a character who participated in a genocide is insensitive.</li>
<li>It’s demeaning to have a Jewish character convert to Christianity, as this belittles/demeans her identity.</li>
<li>That this book was nominated creates an environment where writers of other faiths feel unwelcome.</li>
<li>Wendell expresses disappointment that this book was considered for RWA’s highest honour; “doesn’t understand” how judges would like such an “offensive and insensitive” book.</li>
<li>Wendell questions the judgement of those involved in the process of writing, publishing, nominating the book.</li>
<li>Nomination of the book tarnishes a community of a genre which has changed for the better.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="common-thesis">Common Thesis</h2>
<p>Before replying to these points, I’ll note that both share the same thoughts: <em>“The romance community is becoming more diverse, and this book is offensive, shouldn’t have been nominated, or even written.”</em>.</p>
<p>I find this attitude to not only be toxic, but also exclusionary, and not what reading is all about.</p>
<h2 id="on-diversity-in-media-and-romance-novels">On Diversity in Media and Romance Novels</h2>
<p>Diversity in content isn’t controversial at all. If there are a wide variety of books to read, it benefits the readers, so then not every book involves a handsome billionaire/duke ending up hitched to the hitherto unnoticed wallflower. Lack of monotony is nice. Perhaps more importantly, it’s good if everyone can find a book they like.<br />
– Reading a book is quite special, though, since it let’s you into the mind of the character. The cliche is the reader has experienced many lives by reading through books. And there’s nothing particularly special about putting your feet in the shoes of someone very similar to you.</p>
<p>– I don’t, however, think that just because a book is written and is different necessitates that the book should sell well, or even win awards.</p>
<p>The word “diversity”, as used by Snyder and Wendell, and the social justice crowd, tends to refer to people of different identities; namely: sex/gender, race, and sexuality. They’re also referring to different aspects: diversity in authors, diversity in characters, and diversity in readers.<br />
(I’ll say, personally, as a man who reads romance novels, it’s kinda funny that the lack of men reading, or writing, in the romance community isn’t brought up as a problematic aspect of the romance community; “for women, by women” is a statement of pride rather than an exclusive statement.).</p>
<p>A key concern for Wendell is that the ‘insensitivities’ of this book may make others feel uncomfortable; that people should be uncomfortable with this book, and it should go away.<br />
A key concern for Snyder is that discussion of ‘diversity’ makes the many feel uncomfortable; that people shouldn’t feel uncomfortable with diversity, and those who are should adapt or go away.</p>
<p>– What troubles me is the thought “Romance ought to be a welcoming community / but not for people like this.”; “Diversity is wonderful / so long as people think how I think.”. Because a community homogeneous in its thought, which excludes attitudes it doesn’t like, sounds nothing like diversity to me.</p>
<h2 id="problematic-romance-novels">Problematic Romance Novels</h2>
<p>Diverse or not, a story featuring a Nazi and Jew romancing, set in the Holocaust is obviously offensive, right?<br />
– Well, be honest: even if the characters were on equal footing, wouldn’t you then complain about <a href="http://anonymousdeveloper.tumblr.com/">Jew-sploitation</a>; that the author was appropriating experiences which weren’t her own, and making money off of an awful period in human history? I’m sure someone would have said it.</p>
<p>But, please, let’s not wash over Romance Novels as if each is a paragon of virtue.</p>
<p>I don’t mean “sex before marriage omg” or “man-slut ends up with the girl”:<br />
If “imbalance of power” is a problem for relationships, it’s unfortunate that “romancing the (fake) governess” is such a common trope. Similarly, the “forced-into marriage” trope is problematic in terms of consent.<br />
In terms of more specific examples:<br />
Judith McNaught’s “Whitney, My Love” is a love-it-or-hate-it novel featuring (apparently) a hero who physically beats the heroine.<br />
Lisa Kleypas’ “It Happened One Autumn”, features the hero forcing himself on a resisting heroine; Kleypas then somewhat corrects this in “Scandal in Spring” emphasising this behaviour as <em>bad</em>, which is followed by a scene where the heroine locks the hero in a room, putting the key down her pants (keeping a non-consenting hero in the room).<br />
Loretta Chase’s “Lord of Scoundrels” features the heroine shooting the hero, a somewhat extreme (and uncriticised) example of intimate partner violence.<br />
Sherry Thomas’ “Tempting the Bride” features the hero giving the heroine a novella wherein he describes having sex with the heroine while she’s restrained (against her will) to a bedpost.<br />
etc. etc. – These examples just from the top of my head. And I’ve not read as many books as some others have.</p>
<p>This shouldn’t become a game of Problematic Olympics.<br />
Or, rather, I think that to scream &amp; shout “hey, that’s offensive, don’t write that!” stifles creativity. – The above books are all outstandingly good books, it’d be a shame if they weren’t read for having problems.</p>
<p>I’ll admit I have no faith that cries of “that’s offensive” will be used with discernment.</p>
<h2 id="different-attitudes-amongst-diversity">Different Attitudes Amongst Diversity</h2>
<p>I imagine neither Snyder nor Wendell would be a fan of George Carlin’s (somewhat pro-feminist) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwMukKqx-Os">“don’t let people control what you can or can’t say”</a>.</p>
<p>In any case, it seems an underlying assumption is that “offending others is bad; and making people uncomfortable is at odds with creating an inclusive environment.”. Holding this at the same time as thinking “making the establishment feel uncomfortable is progress” seems a bit inconsistent to me.<br />
What’s certainly not clear is how writers from different (and even conflicting) viewpoints are to express themselves without offending others. “Communal Harmony” vs “Individual Expression” is a conflict any diverse community deals with.</p>
<p>Snyder’s attitude is certainly a not-here-to-make-friends righteousness; and when what’s under discussion is of politics, religion or ethics/morality - subjects people often disagree with each other on - an attitude like that doesn’t foster welcoming for those who differ from the norm.<br />
– Rather than “everyone can think what they want to, so long as it’s behind closed doors, not offending anybody”, it would be nice if people with conflicting viewpoints could come together and discuss things with civility.</p>
<p>– In that regard, it’s deeply, deeply disappointing that both Snyder and Wendell think it would be better if the book weren’t written.<br />
It would probably be worth buying a copy of this RITA-nominated book, if you haven’t already: <a href="https://store.kobobooks.com/en-US/ebook/for-such-a-time-1">Kobo</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/For-Such-Time-Kate-Breslin-ebook/dp/B00DWA695U">Amazon Kindle</a>.</p>
<h2 id="where-to-go-from-here">Where to Go From Here</h2>
<p>Just a reminder that Romance Novels are happy books.<br />
Getting angry with each other and yelling is probably not a constructive effort.</p>
<p>Read a book you hated? (I know I have.). Good! This means your reading includes a diverse range of authors.<br />
Discuss, complain, write angry blogposts if you like. – But don’t aim to silence or other voices; especially not under the guise of “diversity”.</p>
<p>“Don’t be a dick” is always great advice, especially when interacting with others online. I’d love to see more examples of people transcending disagreements, understanding one another and discussing different viewpoints without righteous hobnobbery.<br />
Clearly I need to work on this, just as Wendell might. (Jonathon Haidt is one of the few I know of who can do this well. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vs41JrnGaxc">A relevant, humourous TED talk</a>. Prob’ly the most important link on this page, and it’s left all the way at the bottom..).</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Corrected a few egregious spelling mistakes.</p>
