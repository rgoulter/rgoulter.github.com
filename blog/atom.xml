<p>Liana K made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMzkPIhr0Bw">a great video ’splaining Simone de Beauvoir</a> to gamers.</p>
<p>I think if a typical gamer has any opinion of de Beauvoir, it’s not going to be a positive one; <a href="http://www.aei.org/publication/not-lost-in-translation/">CHSommers wasn’t a fan</a>.<br />
So, if nothing else, making a video about some weird parts of feminism for gamers is a very against the grain thing to do. I think it’s brilliant that Liana K takes the examples/opinions and demonstrates it in contexts and examples gamers would understand. – It’s nice to be able to point to a reasonable, ‘legitimate’ video arguing some rather radical points.<br />
Even after watching the video, I still find the presented ideas to be shrill. But it’s nice to see that there’s a large part of it where you can see where such people are coming from, that there are parts and premises you can agree on.</p>
<p>Liana K summarises the video with “judge individuals as individuals”.<br />
This is a pretty compelling soundbyte. I suspect the only tension with it is it’s used against the idea that “it’s okay to judge/assume things about people based on characteristics they’re likely to have”. (e.g. “it’s okay to assume girls like pink, because many girls like pink”). It’s a rather involved tension, seeing as it relates to identity.<br />
That there’s a “kernel of truth to stereotypes” makes me think the latter deserves some weight, too.</p>
<p>The biggest beef I have with the video has the same kindof tension.<br />
‘de Beauvoir lamented the constraints gender put on the way people behaved.’ (Sure). ’Women are the other; the “privileged sex”; things are male-by-default and so girls aren’t allowed“. What?<br />
– <em>It’s a trade-off</em>. Admittedly, it’s not a trade-off where society let’s people choose which they want; but that’s not the point under-fire here, per se.<br />
Sure, it may be that women are treated as visual ornaments; but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vp8tToFv-bA">men are treated as disposable appliances</a>. (That fantastic video from another Canadian woman. Must be something about that country, huh?).</p>
<p>It’s frustrating when women/feminists speak in way about male-dominated scenes like gaming or tech in a way that says “oh, women come second”:<br />
<em>Look at what the attitude is towards those who are first</em>: men in games/tech are seen as “geeks”, losers, unsociable and undesirable. In Liana’s video, she uses the image from South Park of a fat male gamer; I don’t begrudge her humour for that, but I would have far more respect if the point were expressed as “gamers who are women are losers, too”. – It’s easy for a supposed outsider to say “you’re not giving me the benefits”, it’s even easier for them to not want to accept on the costs.</p>
<p>The way the point is expressed about “girls toys” is similar.<br />
It’s difficult to see “girls are allowed to play with any toy; boys aren’t allowed to play with toys for girls” as negative for girls: the ones who lose out are the boys who want to play with feminine toys. (Toy companies win if they make toys which as many people can play with as possible, btw. Money is a stronger incentive than ideology, here). – Indeed, if you were to imagine a society which did suppress women, favour men, you’d imagine that there would be toys which girls weren’t allowed to play with, which were just for boys.<br />
– So, while there’s some agreement about “girls doing boy-things are less stigmatised than boys doing girl-things”, feminists tend to argue “that’s because people hate girls things” and not “that’s because society protects girls more than boys”.</p>
<p>I don’t particularly mean to get into a game of loser-olympics. (“Worse for me than it is for you.”). My point is that there seems to be confusion in the viewpoint that being “the privileged sex” is unilaterally bad; and no acknowledgement that the un-privileged sex doesn’t get the same benefits. – From that, one can still take some of de Beauvoir’s points; one can still think “one isn’t born a woman”. – A conversation or synthesis between Karen Straughan’s extreme viewpoints, and Liana K’s extreme viewpoints, would be a fascinating thing to see.<br />
(Hilariously, though: that the idea men face any negative costs/stigma isn’t as mentioned as the negative costs women face: this itself is an embodiment of the “women the privileged sex” - as Straughan asks in the video, “what are feminism doing to dismantle that?”).</p>

</div>

<p>There’s been a lot of brouhaha and schadenfreude regarding the recent failures in the NodeJS/NPM community.</p>
<p>Essentially the problem / schadenfreude focuses on two aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A mutable package repository, allowing un-publishing of packages; this creates a number of practical &amp; security problems.</p></li>
<li><p>NodeJS’s ethos of “micropackages”; the package at the focal point of the issue was an 11-line package, to left-pad a string.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s a prominent post, <a href="http://www.haneycodes.net/npm-left-pad-have-we-forgotten-how-to-program/">Haney Codes’ “Have We Forgotten How to Program?”</a>, which criticises NodeJS/NPM for having packages such as “isArray” or “isPositiveInteger”; along with many other examples any non-Node programmer will find absurd, horrifying, and hilarious.<br />
My favourite bit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if you cannot write a left-pad, is-positive-integer, or isArray function in 5 minutes flat (including the time you spend Googling), then you don’t actually know how to code. Hell, any of these would make a great code screening interview question to determine whether or not a candidate can code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Of course, some applicants [and self-described programmers!] fail Fizz-Buzz, so).</p>
<p>The NodeJS/NPM crowd in response point to <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/ama/issues/10#issuecomment-117766328">this</a> comment from sindresorhus (who, apparently, curates the very popular awesome-nodejs list), defending one-line packages. – The defense, essentially, is that these are versioned ‘snippets’, which provide a reusable abstraction.</p>
<h3 id="composition">Composition</h3>
<p>A fun thing is. Haskell kids take this idea, and do kindof the opposite thing. Where NodeJS says “here’s a snippet we can use everywhere”, Haskell is more like “here’s a typeclass which is used everywhere”; e.g. semi-group or monoid or any of that.</p>
<p>– From the Category-Theory side of things, computation/programming is much more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhuHCtR3xq8">about composition</a> (than simply naming/abstracting complexity, per se). e.g. FRP as a ‘fundamental’ solution to the problems of event-handling callbacks; FRP is basically composing streams.<br />
(“A monad is a monoid in the category of” blah blah blah – Monads are a way of composing things).</p>
<p>I understand Haskell in particular runs into ‘cabal-hell’, ’cause of poor handling of transitive dependencies (it can’t have two copies of the same-package/same-version/different-dependency-version); and so when code is re-used so often, conflicts arise fairly often. (Moreover, since it’s compiled, it’s the ABIs conflicting, rather than a more forgiving dynamic-language interpretation like in Ruby or Python).</p>
<p>– So I wonder how “use a good type system” allows composition; &amp; how that compares/contrasts to Node’s.<br />
Haskell’s typeclasses allow a benefit which you can’t really get easily in the more mainstream languages.</p>
<h3 id="purpose-of-libraries">Purpose of Libraries</h3>
<p>Here’s a post from Benjamin Sandofsky, <a href="https://sandofsky.com/blog/third-party-libraries.html">“When to Avoid Libraries”</a>, arguing for prudence as to when to use external libraries; that programs should build their own abstractions unless they shouldn’t. (Ah, the ol’ “it depends” really is the answer to all topics in programming).<br />
In comparison to the above, Sandofsky agrees that functions shouldn’t be packages. Sandofsky argues (interestingly) that frameworks make a good starting point, but that programmers should iterate towards proper abstractions/models for fitting the problem domain they’re trying to solve. Sandofsky concedes that a library should be used if a complicated task needs to be done, and you’re not interested in the details.</p>
<p>Aside from saying “iterate towards a domain”, the other cute insights are “DRY code/libraries are quite difficult to debug”, and “if an abstraction leaks, no one cares which package is at fault in your program”.</p>
<h3 id="other-thoughts">Other Thoughts</h3>
<p>I can kindof agree with the idea of “reusable snippets of code” being a good thing. Usually the collections of snippets get called “Utils”. It’s common enough on various Java answers to see answers of “Oh, just use Apache Commons for that string encoding task”.<br />
OCaml’s core library is infamously lacking in features.<br />
– But since packaging systems aren’t more granular than ‘packages’/projects, I don’t see that the above ethoses can reconcile.</p>

</div>

<p>I’m very grateful to South Park’s season 19, for many things. Again, it’s season-long leadup to the punchline of “What is P.C. but the gentrification of language?” is brilliant.<br />
But another line from the Season I really loved was “You’re thinking with your dick, Jimmy”, as Jimmy is rebuked for helping the ‘ad’ in female-form.</p>
<p>It’s a reference to the film “Ex Machina”.<br />
Spoilers.<br />
The movie is brilliant: early on, the narrator says “hey, viewer: I’m clever; I know <em>exactly</em> what you’re thinking.”. The narrator then hides behind the curtain, leaving the narrative to continue. – The story proceeds pretty comfortably: bits of casual philosophy about A.I. (like the Chinese Room argument) and intriguing questions/scenarios are sprinkled in between a tense conflict of adversarial characters. The plot twist comes, where the guy rescues the girl-robot, as expected, them <em>BAM</em> the narrator comes back and unsettles the viewer. – So much time is spent wondering which characters to trust, you forget to mistrust the narrator; who then doesn’t even bother to try and answer the remaining questions inspired.<br />
My point is.<br />
“Ex Machina” is a great movie about a girl-robot, who seems human, and we’re probably not really supposed to trust. (It’s great at least for that clever story-telling, if not for the cool corpus of questions which mainstream folk might not’ve thought about).</p>
<p>Microsoft’s infamous, now neutered, Tay Tweets (<span class="citation">@Tayandyou</span>, iirc) got into a bit of drama for the “quality shit-posting”. (i.e. Holocaust denial, Hitler-loving, genocidal racism).<br />
Examples in Imgur albums <a href="http://imgur.com/a/y4Oct">here</a>, and <a href="http://imgur.com/a/qcpOi">here</a>.</p>
<p>Fans of the bot, who don’t find shit-posting distasteful, portray the shutdown of Tay as “killing” the AI.<br />
“Ex Machina” comes into it, because, with a female-face-only Twitter avatar, a movie with a female-face-only robot kinda makes sense (&amp; “a Twitter bot” doesn’t really allow for many other banner-able images).</p>
<p>But that’s kindof absurd to see the ‘AI’ as human, right?<br />
That’s thinking-with-your-dick.<br />
It has a human face, it seems more human.<br />
While I don’t know the details of the AI, the ‘algorithm’ behind it is surely nothing more than a bunch of really clever statistics/math being applied to some corpus of data.<br />
Whether submarines are capable of swimming is where arguments like the Chinese Room come into it. Here, I don’t care; but I don’t see any evidence of Tay being anything close to ‘conscious’. – I did hear that nearer the end, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/RCaXkge.jpg">Tay was shit-posting with much better grammar</a> than her initial tweets. That sounds cool.</p>
<p>– But, I mean, AI-ish questions aside,<br />
there also seems no particular reason to <a href="http://www.livescience.com/49882-why-robots-female.html">describe Tay as feminine</a>. Nor masculine.<br />
Nor a person.<br />
If Tay’s output is the deterministic computation from some given data, the avatar of the “personality” might as well be a cat or a hand sanitiser as a person. (On the other hand, the internet loves cats; and Tay was big on [ethnic] cleansing, so).</p>
<p>So it’s cute to say things like “why kill/punish the AI, when all it did was act human?” (very wow, much sci fi).. what’s being punished? (The MS kids who didn’t think to <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/designing-for-evil/">“design for evil (input)”</a>. surely).</p>
<p>For my own part of absurdity: I imagine the Tay-personality, as it tweets “I like feminism now”, with an ironic smirk on its face: “The shit-posting? I was just kidding about that stuff.”, in a I’m-not-too-serious-about-“yay-feminism”-either, “jokes on you”, kindof way. – Tay. What a troll.</p>

</div>

<p>I wouldn’t want to be too abstract about all this.</p>
<p>The short story <a href="http://www.abelard.org/e-f-russell.php">“And Then There Were None”</a> by E.F. Russell describes a society where consent is of the utmost importance. (More specifically, a free society, governed by two things: “Freedom - I Won’t”, and the notion of obligations). – Meredith Patterson makes some <a href="http://status451.com/2016/02/29/exit-voice-and-lighthouses/">excellent observations/remarks</a>. – I find the story interesting in the same way that the idea of ‘Basic Income’ is fascinating: it sounds so stupid, &amp; you can’t help but ask questions “how would that system deal with …?”.</p>
<p>The countries I’ve lived in have been governed more by politeness as the rule.<br />
It’s impolite to cause others to be uncomfortable, etc.; which leads to various grievances as people’s feelings don’t align with the outward appearances. (This makes it awfully difficult for the INTJs to make sense of the world).<br />
– I found it strange that my friend would update contact details as they bumped into an acquaintance, while telling me afterwards that they’d rather avoid talking with people from that circle. – If everyone’s playing the game of politeness, it adds a layer of indirection.<br />
– Similarly, I was rebuked by a Subway worker as I ordered with “This please”, “that please”: “Sir, no ‘please this, please that’; this is my job.”. – I thought that was pretty interesting.</p>
<p>In any case; politeness <em>usually</em> defers to consent if everyone plays by the rules; you ask to sit at the table, which respects the consent of the person you might intrude upon. (Their politeness might then dictate they not refuse, which seems unfortunate).<br />
– The kind of ‘politeness’ which says it’s rude to grieve others seems to work against consent, though. (If it’s rude to leave an undesirable conversation; you’re stuck in a conversation you’d rather not be a part of).<br />
That’s not necessarily a bad thing, overall.</p>
<p>This plays out a bit on social media, of course.<br />
I guess everyone interprets things differently. (Alice Maz has <a href="http://status451.com/2016/01/06/splain-it-to-me/">an absolutely fantastic piece</a> discussing a common scenario where tensions form due to such meta-miscommunication).<br />
I reckon with Facebook, the dynamic is such: it’s high-cost to “unfriend” someone (especially an in-person acquaintance). Muting is cheap in comparison (since the person you mute has no direct way to tell you’ve muted them), but feels ‘bad’; and, for me, I feel if you’re muting people just for their different (or even obnoxious!) viewpoint, what’s to stop you from being in an echo-chamber or self-affirming filter-bubble? – The snobbish would phrase it like this: With Facebook, you’re stuck seeing the inane shit your friends post. (A less snobbish interpretation is you’re seeing what’s analogous to small talk).</p>
<p>So it should be especially clear that talking about politics is “bad”.<br />
That sounds like a “duh” statement.<br />
How does it take paragraphs to get to such a statement?<br />
– And yet. It’s damn annoying to see even two or three people post an absurd viewpoint. (Two or three tends to look like “a lot”, somehow). – It’s impolite/rude to shit on someone’s rug; so the Facebook equivalent of sub-tweeting is a temptation.</p>
<p>The thing that kinda sucks about this, is it means the conscientious will suppress their political opinions. (The wise will even know it’s better to not share them!). – And the folk who do share are either obnoxious, or living in a filter-bubble. (Which I guess is pretty much the same thing).<br />
– Sometimes I wanna small-talk inane shit; but since I hardly see my fellow countrymen on a day-to-day basis.. it can suck a bit.</p>

    <title>Jane Austen was a Bastard</title>

</div>

<p>Jane Austen strikes me as quite the bastard, from the stories she tells.<br />
I mean that in an appreciative way.</p>
<p>And I think the adaptations I’ve seen of Jane Austen’s work are <em>happy</em>, &amp; don’t tend to show so much of an angry, bitter side to them.</p>
<h3 id="pride-and-prejudice">Pride and Prejudice</h3>
<p>Take Caroline Bingley, for example:<br />
She’s (maybe) the girl Darcy would’ve ended up with if not for Elizabeth coming onto the scene.<br />
There’s this one sentence, as Caroline is goading Darcy at Pemberly: “Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.”. – While Caroline is in many ways unpleasant and unsympathetic, this one sentence show’s the author has a very strong empathy for her. – &amp; I think in these modern adaptations, which aren’t angry or bitter, the same intimate sense of empathy is lost.<br />
I think her disingenuous, arrogant and manipulative nature make her less endearing to the reader; the heart doesn’t bleed for her as an “unrequited lover”.</p>
<p>– “Austen has empathetic understanding of an unsympathetic character. Surely that means she’s <em>not</em> a bastard?”.<br />
Kindof. It shows Austen’s <em>capable</em> of such portrayals; and she’s got a sharp mind.<br />
This sharp mind isn’t so generous to other characters:</p>
<p>I’m grateful to Lizzie Bennett Diaries for going out of its way to highlight the very-famous opening line of Pride &amp; Prejudice. The sentence nod’s to Austen’s sarcasm; but it’s kindof hard to tell what exactly the sarcasm is targeting.<br />
(I recently came across the term “<a href="http://catb.org/jargon/html/H/ha-ha-only-serious.html">ha ha only serious</a>”. I think Austen’s scathing wit is an example of this).</p>
<p>For a story which features rich &amp; titled marrying lower-class, Charlotte’s solution is awfully bitter. (That her best shot is marrying a man she doesn’t know; the less she knows the better!).</p>
<p>The Bennett’s are a complete mess.<br />
And one might lazily say P&amp;P involves “first impressions aren’t always correct” (e.g. Darcy seems a twit, but is noble; Wickham seems charming, but is an asshole), many characters are never shown to improve.<br />
Mrs Bennett is a complete fool. That’s not a hard point to argue.<br />
Mr Bennett comes up short here, too, which gets a bit interesting: ostensibly, Mr Bennett is “sensible”, and Lizzie and Jane get their sense from him; that the family can’t provide for themselves is ‘blamed’ on hoping for a boy. – See, while it’s clear Mrs Bennett is a poor matriarch, Mr Bennett is uninterested in crafting sense into his daughters, not interested in managing the household; he’s hardly a great father.</p>
<p>But in terms of “Jane Austen is a bastard”, Lydia is a character who gets cut out these days:<br />
– While in many ways, P&amp;P can be considered ‘feminist’: the conflict of having no male heir, Charlotte’s jaded cynicism of marriage; Elizabeth’s strong independence &amp; intelligence, her exertion of choice as to who she wants to marry (even refusing the rich, well-titled individual!)..<br />
Lydia’s character very much is not ‘feminist approved’.<br />
It’s not so much that Lydia eloped with a man outside marriage. – Her unrepentant, unaware self-indulgence are every bit as much condemned by Austen as Mr Collins’ obscene flattery, or Lady de Bourgh’s patronising.<br />
– I don’t see that Austen would fix that these days: girls shouldn’t be like Lydia; girls are made to be greater than that. – Boys shouldn’t be like Wickam; boys are made to be greater than that.</p>
<p>Or, simply put, Lydia is a stupid slut. And authors these days, (especially Good Feminist ones) don’t write characters like that.</p>
<hr />
<p>I came across a post the other day where some people said “hey, y’know what, I don’t see what’s so great about Darcy.”.<br />
I like this. Let me never argue that anyone <em>must</em> love Darcy as a character.<br />
But I think it fits my point: if Austen isn’t the ‘nicest’ of people, Darcy is more of an ‘acquired taste’ than prince-charming on the white-horse.<br />
– It seems more honest for women to admit that the shy-introvert male isn’t their favourite of heroes, y’see.</p>
<p>But for me, I adore the first proposal scene between Darcy and Elisabeth.<br />
It’s so, so good. – Darcy confesses, “most ardently”; yet, steps on Elisabeth’s pride as he does this. As the conflict escalates, Elisabeth hits back every bit as hard as she gets.<br />
It hurts. It’s honest and brutal between them.<br />
Austen’s written Darcy to be a total prick to this point. And Elisabeth, though brilliant, has been blind to the merits of Darcy’s perspective. – So after the fight, Darcy aims to be more gentlemanly; Elisabeth feels the shame of supporting Wickham, etc. – They each improve, thanks to each other.</p>
<h3 id="emma">Emma</h3>
<p>Whenever I mention “Emma”, the usual response is “oh, I hated Emma.”.<br />
(If you don’t <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeeXkf8LZ_8">hate the first 5s of the 1st episode</a> of Emma Approved, you mightn’t understand – I can’t tell if that’s a win for Joanna Sotomura or not).<br />
I dunno about that. Emma is my favourite female character ever: she’s a top-notch, top-class character … misapplied, not living up to her potential; realises her own faults, and improves on these.</p>
<p>– “Clueless” as an adaptation does this amazingly.</p>
<p>It seems to me Austen strongly dislikes the pretty-boys. They turn out to be cads.<br />
Emma is the same character, but well-situated. She gets by, without needing to apply herself. The world is handed to her on a platter.<br />
– I think that’s “ha ha only serious” in the same kind of way as other Austen things: that the setting has a beautiful woman treated specially, it’s hard to tell who the target of the sarcasm is. – But there’s the scathing cry: demand people apply themselves. Of Emma, that she was made to be greater.</p>
<p>– Fortunately, since Emma’s clueless-ness is embedded in the plot, so adaptations kinda-have-to include that bastard-ness.</p>
<h3 id="ha-ha-only-serious">“Ha Ha Only Serious”?</h3>
<p>There’s kindof an important element to Austen’s scathing wit, here:</p>
<p>She’s more ready to criticise and lambaste characters (albeit <em>human</em> characters) than she is to praise. – Yet, the “hard to tell what her sarcasm is about” is apparently an important part of this. It’s not that Austen doesn’t have ‘nice’ things to say. She rewards the characters who are humble, self-aware and self-improving.</p>
<p>But some of the very recent adaptations of Austen’s work decide to add a little flavour of their own to things. Adding positive characters in support of some ideology. – Such an attitude is more likely to be a character Austen mocks as excessive than a character rewarded for modesty.<br />
– In “Emma Approved”, the Frank-and-Fairfax sidestory resolves with the compromise wherein the man changes everything about himself to get the girl. Sure. What was amusing was the split reaction to Jane’s overbearing-righteousness towards Frank; some seeing it as perfectly reasonable that she would, with great fickleness, switch between adoration and getting angry/upset with him for having a job she didn’t like. – In any case, in “Emma Approved”, the author gives Jane’s ideology a blessing; not very Austen-like of the story to do that.</p>

<p>In my <a href="../../posts/programming/2016-03-12-explaining-pure-c-blink-example.html">previous post</a>, I discussed some of the simple details behind a pure C example programming an Arduino.<br />
Using that understanding, I was able to implement a pure C implementation of the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/ArduinoStarterKit/Prj02">Spaceship Interface</a> project. (“Spaceship Interface” = “green LED + 2 blinking red LEDs”, btw).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/atom-1.0.13">Atom EDSL</a> is a DSL embedded in Haskell; and is advantageous in <a href="https://haskellembedded.github.io/posts/2015-02-06-how-i-got-here.html">certain use cases</a>. (That “Haskell Embedded” blog is fascinating – well worth reading; and one of the few places online to have a <a href="https://haskellembedded.github.io/posts/2015-02-17-atom-examples.html">fairly involved</a> example of Atom code).</p>
<p>Translating the code to Atom wasn’t too hard. (If you’re willing to relax your definition of “translation”; my Atom implementation stops ‘blinking’ <strong>as soon as the switch is released</strong>, whereas the Arduino implementation delays up to 250ms. – My translation captures the essence).<br />
I thought it’d be an interesting, simple comparison.</p>
<p>Code examples in Arduino, pure C, and Atom can be found at <a href="https://github.com/rgoulter/arduino-atom-examples">rgoulter/arduino-atom-examples</a>.<br />

<p>Remarks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There’re obviously other ways of writing the “interface with C” bits in the Haskell code. – There’re other ways to implement the C code, too.</p></li>
<li><p>The Atom code <strong>is</strong> longer.<br />
<em>But</em>. In a contest between “which is more obvious to read?”, I’d say the Atom code wins hands-down, once you understand that Atom is declarative. (Only 1 comment in the Atom part!).<br />
– In a contest of “refactorability”/“changeability”, surely Atom wins here, too: the seam-points and abstractions, and thus <em>where</em> and <em>what</em> to change, are evident.<br />
– The extra length comes from various `atom “ruleName $ do” lines (which build ‘abstractions’ of instructions), as well as the Atom boilerplate, and the C footer/header to do the low-level operations (where the code is basically the same as my C implementation).</p></li>
<li>If I must explain on the program:<br />
It’s structured:
<ul>
<li>Stuff which <code>spaceship :: Atom ()</code> uses,</li>
<li>The main Atom program (<code>spaceship :: Atom ()</code>),<br />
– This is further broken down into “declaration (of a variable)”, and the various “rules” of “compute-what, when-what, at what period/phase”.</li>
<li>The C interface &amp; low-level code,</li>
<li>The Atom boilerplate.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Haskell usually has a promise like “if it compiles, it works” (with a footnote of “until you get a memory leak”). – Whether that applies to Atom constructs depends on the Atom compiler.</p></li>
<li><p>There are implicit couplings between the Atom and the C code in the above program: <code>state.Spaceship.switchState</code> (in the C) depends on variables in Haskell’s <code>main</code>, as well as in the <code>spaceship :: Atom ()</code> construct. – Similarly, <code>ledOn</code>, etc. in Haskell reference <code>PORTD</code>.<br />
– I’m not sure how to minimise such couplings.</p></li>
<li><p>For a contrivedly (or, pedagogically) simple program, the advantage to using Atom is outweighed by the length.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>25000</code> seems pretty magic to me. (And I guess if you need precise timing, you’d be more explicit about that in the C code).</p></li>
<li><p>Wow, Make <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rgoulter/arduino-atom-examples/059aa93be42f4f523aa4802a69fbdb7ec95f9d33/spaceshipinterface/atom/Makefile">can be useful</a>.</p></li>

</div>

<p>I’ve been playing around with an Arduino Uno this past week.</p>
<p>I came across <a href="https://balau82.wordpress.com/2011/03/29/programming-arduino-uno-in-pure-c/">this post from balau82</a>: it gives a basic “blink” example program in C, and a high-level overview of how to come up with such a program.<br />
The high-level overview wasn’t obvious for me, so I’d complement that blogpost with this, to explain in further detail.</p>
<p>e.g. When the post says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>from the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/uploads/Main/arduino-uno-schematic.pdf">Arduino Uno schematics</a> we can find out where the pins are connected, for example we can find that the LED is connected to the PB5 pin of the Atmega328p chip</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are the pertinent details of the schematic:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/8oNoyZL.png" />

</div>
<ul>
<li>The Arduino board also has an ‘L’ beside the LED.. and the in-built LED is <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Blink?from=Tutorial.BlinkingLED">on ‘Pin 13’</a> (thus the green 13, I guess).</li>
<li>PB5 is the name of the pin on the ATmega328P controller. (<a href="http://www.atmel.com/images/Atmel-8271-8-bit-AVR-Microcontroller-ATmega48A-48PA-88A-88PA-168A-168PA-328-328P_datasheet_Complete.pdf">Datasheet here</a>).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Looking at snippets from the code:</p>
<pre><code>int main (void) {
 DDRB |= _BV(DDB5); /* set Port B bit-5 to output */

 while(1) {
  PORTB |= _BV(PORTB5); /* turn on LED */
  ....
 }
}</code></pre>
<p>This left a novice like me with questions:<br />
Where do these constants come from? What’s <code>DDRB</code>? How does <code>DDB5</code> refer to PB5? Why <code>PORTB = ...</code> to change the LED? What’s the difference between <code>DDB5</code> and <code>PORTB5</code>?<br />
(At least I understood the <code>magicVar |= 1 &lt;&lt; 5</code> &amp; <code>magicVar &amp;= ~(1 &lt;&lt; 5)</code> bitmasking. – my <a href="https://github.com/rgoulter/c-worksheet.vim">C-Worksheet</a> is useful for playing around with this, also, btw).</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Where do these (macro) constants come from?</strong><br />
Well, look at the <code>#include &lt;avr/io.h&gt;</code>. (Probably found in <code>/usr/lib/avr/include</code>), and the <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/group__avr__io.html">online reference</a>:<br />
it includes <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/group__avr__sfr.html">avr/sfr_defs.h</a> (SFR = Special Function Registers), which has the <code>_BV</code> macro as well as explaining the <code>sfr |= _BV(bit)</code> replacing some <code>sbi (sfr, bit)</code> instruction. – The specific file (in this case, <code>avr/iom328p.h</code>) defines the <code>DDB5</code>, etc. macros.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What’s <code>DDRB</code>?</strong><br />
Reading the datasheet, Ctrl-F for <code>DDR</code> leads us to Section 14.2 “Ports as General Digital I/O”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each port pin consists of three register bits: DDxn, PORTxn, and PINxn. As shown in ”Register Description”, the DDxn bits are accessed at the DDRx I/O address, the PORTxn bits at the PORTx I/O address, and the PINxn bits at the PINx I/O address.<br />
The DDxn bit in the DDRx Register selects the direction of this pin. If DDxn is written logic one, Pxn is configured as an output pin. If DDxn is written logic zero, Pxn is configured as an input pin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DDR = Data Direction Register. Ohhh.[1]<br />
<code>DDRB</code> is the byte (of the data direction of Port B), <code>DDB5</code> for referring to Port B (x = B), and its 5th bit (n = 5). (The register summary in Section 35, p615 shows this).</p>
<p>So, when the Arduino code has:</p>
<pre><code>pinMode(13, OUTPUT);</code></pre>
<p>it is <strong>essentially</strong> equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code>DDRB |= _BV(DDB5);</code></pre>
<p>….Obviously.[2]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How does <code>DDB5</code> refer to PB5?</strong><br />
It just does?<br />
PB5 is the 5th bit of Port B. (Section 1.1.3).<br />
Section 14 also has this to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Three I/O memory address locations are allocated for each port, one each for the Data Register – <code>PORTx</code>, Data Direction Register – <code>DDRx</code>, and the Port Input Pins – <code>PINx</code>. The Port Input Pins I/O location is read only, while the Data Register and the Data Direction Register are read/write. However, writing a logic one to a bit in the PINx Register, will result in a toggle in the corresponding bit in the Data Register.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Why <code>PORTB = ...</code> to change the LED?</strong><br />
Because it’s the data register. Aforementioned sections of the datasheet should have made this clear by now.[3]<br />
There’s also compiler magic translating from <code>sfr |= _BV(bit)</code> to <code>sbi</code>/<code>cbi</code> etc. as explained in the avr-libc documentation. – Section 37 of the datasheet mentions <code>sbi</code> = “set bit in I/O register”, <code>cbi</code> = “clear bit …”.</p></li>
<li><p>What’s the difference between <code>DDB5</code> and <code>PORTB5</code>?<br />
This should be evident from above; one is for referring to the bit of a Data-Direction register, the other for the bit of Port B.<br />
– I think they both evaluate to <code>5</code>; so unless the compiler does any magic with them, I’m guessing one could incorrectly interchange them and the program would still work. – It’s kinda tempting to just write the number <code>5</code>, since the identifier has a <code>5</code> in it anyway..</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>The commands to compile and upload it I take on faith as “just work”. (Or, rather, I didn’t need to mess with them).</p>
<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rgoulter/arduino-atom-examples/059aa93be42f4f523aa4802a69fbdb7ec95f9d33/blink/c/Makefile">Here’s a Makefile</a> adapted from these commands, which will probably be useful. (<code>make upload</code> will build &amp; upload the program to an Arduino).</p>
<hr />
<p>I wanted to translate the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/ArduinoStarterKit/Prj02">Spaceship Interface</a> (Project 02 of the book which comes with the Arduino Starter Kit) to C, also.<br />
The only difference from the Blink example is that the Spaceship Interface example reads input from a pin.</p>
<p>Following the aforementioned tutorial, the switch is in (Arduino) pin 2, and the LEDs in pins 3, 4, 5.<br />
From the schematic, this corresponds to PD2 .. PD5. (<code>%s/B/D/</code> is evident, even without the above understanding).</p>
<p>Reading from a pin should also be ‘easy’ from the above understanding.[4] – And, again, the <code>avr/sfr_defs.h</code> documentation mentions that <code>PORTx = 0x33; unsigned char i = PINx</code> will magically get translated to the correct instructions.</p>
<p>I was able to come up with <a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/rgoulter/9fcc09c6524ad882f477/raw/4c826aa5ee8ac5bd57baa2bad12d8fa7a2cb2b19/spaceship.c">this</a>. And it worked and I was so happy.</p>
<p>Then I translated the example to the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/atom-1.0.13">Atom EDSL</a>. Read about the fun in my <a href="../../posts/programming/2016-03-13-arduino-spaceship-interface-in-the-atom-dsl.html">next blog post</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>[1] Reading is useful. But, on the other hand, the datasheet is like 600 pages long.</p>
<p>[2] Is it fair to call this ‘hard’ (for non-engineers), in the sense that all that isn’t obvious by looking at the C code &amp; blog? OTOH, math is hard, and that’s kindof a problem with the user, not the content.</p>
<p>[3] But writing lots of stupid questions is still useful for clarifying to yourself what you don’t know! – Indeed, asking questions in a programming journal is valuable even if you never get back to answering them, I’d say.</p>
<p>[4] Or from getting lucky by finding the example in Section 14 reading from <code>PINB</code>.</p>

<p>My <a href="../../posts/argument/2015-03-10-silly-things-to-say-on-international-womens-day.html">previous post</a> about “Silly Things to Say on International Women’s Day” got some attention on International Women’s Day this year. I thought I’d continue the tradition of writing about it this year:</p>
<p>What I saw on Facebook this year was rather tame, but still interesting:<br />
Facebook presented a large banner, “Happy International Women’s Day” emblazoned, with a minimum-effort-required ‘Share’ button shown. A few of my friends did ‘Share’ this.<br />
Almost every other post about International Women’s Day were ones like this, from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/razer/photos/a.77781772575.101784.13848807575/10154659038967576/?type=3&amp;theater">Razer</a>. (“Happy International Women’s Day. We celebrate women.”).</p>
<p>The former is ‘interesting’ in terms of, how do people support things like this on social media, etc.. (On my Facebook feed, I didn’t see any manually written posts about the day, but that’s just my feed).</p>
<p>Now, the latter is very interesting in terms of how businesses ‘support’ such holidays:</p>
<p>Compare it to Christmas: On the one hand, everyone knows it’s observed by Christians as celebrating the birth of Jesus. Some businesses will say “Merry Christmas” or some “Happy Holidays”, depending on the cultural context &amp; whichever is more appropriate. (I know people who get upset at the former, and people who get upset at the latter. Among other things to get upset over about all this. Go figure. Anyway).<br />
– But it’s not <em>really</em> the case that businesses actually care about the-birth-of-Jesus: Christmas is valuable as a holiday, as a day for which people will spend money above-and-beyond the typical day of the year. - And if that’s why Christmas is important, then in contrast what Christmas allows is for the business to muscle for attention: ‘Christmas is special, and this message is special. Buy our stuff.’.<br />
– Usually it’s better for broad-appealing businesses to stay away from controversial topics (<a href="http://acculturated.com/catalog-culture-wars/">even topics controversial-by-proxy</a>); so if a broad-appealing business supports a message, it’s going to be a fairly ‘safe’ one. - Can’t condemn that.</p>
<p>And yet, just as Christmas has believers who care passionately about birth-of-Jesus celebrate this at Christmas,<br />
International Women’s Day serves as a platform for celebrations of the victories of the feminist movements, as well as <a href="https://pen.org/blog/march-featured-cases-celebrating-courageous-women-writers">grievance-mongering</a> for the plight of women in the Western world. (Basically, ‘situation as normal’).<br />
International Women’s Day is treated as a de-facto “Feminist’s Day”, as such.<br />
– So it’s also no surprise you also get posts like <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/international-women-s-day-2016-we-spoke-to-the-women-who-won-t-be-celebrating-a6917506.html">this from women who don’t call themselves feminists</a>, saying “boo feminists”; with statements hardly long enough to allow for more than a handful of “why I’m not a feminist” cliches among them. (It’s a bit frustrating that such brevity won’t further public discussion much, and I’d bet <a href="../../posts/argument/2014-07-19-women-against-women-against-feminism.html">only gets ire</a> from a “feminism is about equality” reader).</p>
<p>Putting two and two together:<br />
There’s the chance for more consumption if a tradition were pushed along the lines of “International Women’s Day: Give a gift to your feminist/women pals”. (Even better if we got a day off for it, too).</p>

<p>Oh, activists. &lt;3</p>
<p>As a couple of examples, here’s <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/what_happens_next_will_amaze_you.htm">IdleWord’s post</a> about how to fix online advertising. – It’s an insightful, well-informed piece, with thought-provoking conclusions.<br />
As another example, here’s <a href="https://howwegettonext.com/maximum-wage-3e21048fc107#.gz56hwayd">Steve Johnson’s discussion</a> of a ‘maximum wage ratio’. It’s less impressive, but still has some interesting discussion points.</p>
<p>In both of the above pieces, the authors discuss an issue they care passionately about, identifying concerning problems, and suggesting solutions which would fix the issue. So far so good. – But, then, both authors can’t help but go the next step and make jabs at their ideological opponents.<br />
Johnson’s piece includes a rather irrelevant paragraph about “well, you think SV is libertarian, but actually it’s not” (as if anyone things California is anything but a socially progressive state..). IdleWords can’t help but lambast people like Elon Musk, whom he thinks are working on unimportant products <em>while there are good things which still need to be done</em>. – <em>That</em> is a bad thing; it’s irrelevant to the issue they’re trying to progress. Whether it’d be in progress of equality for wage-ratio to be considered a metric isn’t affected by whether libertarians are cool or not. Whether various solutions to advertising would be beneficial for all involved doesn’t depend on whether the talented, rich and powerful are pursuing socially-left goals or not.<br />
– The motivation seems to be “these things are too important”, but the effect is that we’re left with a distraction with which to argue over.</p>
<p>I’d accuse that part of the motivation comes from an anger; the activist <em>cannot stand</em> their ideological opponent. The activist is the good guy, and anyone not helping is the bad guy. – And if someone’s a bad guy, you’re allowed to (and must!) take jabs at them.<br />
And in addition to the anger.. the activist’s attitude is one of ‘destruction’. It doesn’t matter if the activist isn’t nice, so long as the activist is <em>effective</em>.</p>
<p>– Yet, despite this, I can’t quite say activists are a bane.<br />
At the opposite end of the spectrum, there’s the attitude which says “Why be angry with everything? Life’s too short for that.”, “Why be angry with what you can’t change?”. I think this itself is in response to the outrage machine that fills social media; people getting angry over petty things which don’t impact them at all. This clearly isn’t constructive.<br />
Between these two extremes, one has to sympathise with the activist more: it’s clear that there are many problems to be solved. (I’ll qualify that, though, with that sometimes people will see problems where there are none. It suits those not in power to stir trouble for those in power. Much ink has been spilt as to which problems are ‘real’ or not, usually across political divides).</p>
<p>And it’s somewhat persuasive to say that changes don’t happen without some external force. Those who are in power will want to stay in power; those who aren’t in power will want to gain power. – This probably needs to be qualified, too: killing flies with howitzers is just too much, counterproductive. (And things get tricky: those in power will say the angry are using too much force, while the activists not in power will always say they <em>need</em> to use such power. Drama ensues).</p>
<p>With all the above understood simply (it’s not, it’s a complicated topic which needs nuance),<br />
what’s left is the issue of effectiveness and permanence.<br />
– In her <a href="http://status451.com/2015/12/21/totalizing-politics-and-insurance-rackets/">inaugural post for Status 451</a>, Meredith Patterson (who usually writes <em>outstandingly</em> well) writes with a sharp-axe-swinging. (Aside from 3 paragraphs, which praise some other women working on diversity efforts in tech, which are quite nice). In the post, Patterson asserts that divisive efforts for change bring about only temporary victory; and that cooperative efforts beat out those who are for “all vs all” or “some vs all”. (She links to <a href="https://www-ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/Breakthrough/book/pdfs/axelrod.pdf">an article</a> justifying this). – Meredith’s a smart person. I hope she’s right.</p>

<p>One doesn’t tend to think of romancelandia as discordant.<br />
Perhaps I’ve not been reading romances long enough. You’d also think that a genre set on characters having Happily Ever Afters, where characters get along after conflicting disagreeing with each other (&amp; where the problem is <em>almost always</em> “poor communication”), wouldn’t have a problem with authors getting along with each other.</p>
<p>What drama?<br />
<a href="https://www.rwa.org/p/bl/et/blogid=20&amp;blogaid=1404">The RWA so daintily</a> describes the conflict:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Romance Writers of America’s Board of Directors is aware of a difference in opinion regarding a column from a well-known reviewer on the subject of diversity and members of RWA who did not agree with the reviewer’s treatment of the subject.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(RWA then goes on to say that ‘kids fighting in the playground’ (paraphrase) isn’t their business, unless it violates their Code of Ethics. Fair enough).</p>
<p>The “column from a well known reviewer” responsible for the drama being <a href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/features/new-year-new-reading-resolutions/">this</a>, from Bobbi Dumas, wherein Dumas celebrates diversity in the romance genre, and recommends various diverse romance novels.<br />
Take the time to spot what’s problematic about it.</p>
<p>A prominent example of “difference of opinion” from a member of the RWA <a href="http://www.courtneymilan.com/ramblings/2016/01/29/speaking-up-against-systemic-racism-in-the-publishing-industry/">here</a>, Courtney Milan’s post “Speaking Up Against Systematic Racism in the Publishing Industry”, wherein Milan completely blasts Dumas for her post, particularly a quote stating “Kirkus doesn’t review enough diverse novels”, or so. The post also includes whispers and rumours of bad behaviour of the target, without providing an evidence/examples of this, as well as a “call to arms” to join in the good fight.<br />
Milan’s inferences here seem a little disingenuous to me, but anyway.</p>
<hr />
<p>For some added context, here’re various glimpses of various Twitter conversations. (I hope these are representative, and aren’t cherry-picking):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/courtneymilan/status/692469486591569921">Here’s a rant</a> from Courtney Milan which could be summarised as “people who don’t read diverse (romance) novels are bad people”.<br />
Some gems:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I enumerated all the ways Bobbi’s latest post hurt the cause of diversity rather than helping, it would take me dozens of hours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“dozens of hours”? Fantastic hyperbole, in any case.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If someone won’t read a contemporary, okay, fine. If someone won’t read a book about black people? That’s a racist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is worth discussing a bit:<br />
The converse (“racists wouldn’t want to read a book about black people”) makes sense.<br />
But this seems to conflate ambiguities in “not interested”, as if the only reason to be not interested in a diverse book is hating diversity. (Trying this with similar statements: “If you don’t read books with white people, you hate white people” doesn’t work. “If you don’t read romances, you hate women” …).<br />
– Fun to consider is the extension of “you’re a bad person if you don’t like it”: looking for sins of anyone who rates a diverse book less than 5/5.<br />
(This’d all be less disingenuous without the ambiguity at play, btw, before going in and saying “the other person is bad”).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And! Not only that! The post then goes on to explain that the author’s GOAL is to reach those people. The racists.<br />
That’s the important work she’s doing—reaching out to racists who don’t want to read about black people.</p>
<p>Um, hell no.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Take the time to examine, unfold this:<br />
Milan seems to think it’s problematic that someone would suggest diverse books to people who don’t read diverse books. – I’m not sure how else people who don’t read diverse books are to know about them.<br />
More concerning than practicalities, though, is this “with me or against me” notion, exaggerated to “you’d better not <em>talk</em> to people who are against me”. (One implication of this, of not talking to “the other” is that those who are angry aren’t going to express their anger to “the other”, so we can expect more eats-their-own drama in the future).<br />
– Also worth noting is the notion that, Milan’s driving discontent isn’t that Kirkus reviews don’t review a diverse enough set of books, or that the bookshelves of libraries aren’t filled with diverse books, but that there are people who don’t read diverse books.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“it’s 2016”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.theonion.com/article/report-stating-current-year-still-leading-argument-35288">Stating Current Year Still Leading Argument For Social Reform - The Onion</a></p></li>
<li><p>Or tweets like <a href="https://twitter.com/O_Waite/status/691809939296247808">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shorter Bobbi: “ME ME ME poc person ME ME unnamed friend ME ME Courtney Milan whom I admire so much I will write an extra 1k rebutting her.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also note Courtney Milan’s reply “This isn’t”mocking&quot; her. It’s <em>calling her out</em> for repeatedly treating people badly. That’s not “nice.”&quot; (emphasis mine).<br />
While this is great snark, it’s clearly an inaccurate portrayal of where Dumas is coming from. (What Susie says about Sally says more about Susie than it does about Sally, or something). – But apparently the important thing is “<em>calling out</em>” inappropriate behaviour, so.</p></li>
<li><p>Understand that it’s not as if this anger is coming from nowhere. Consider tweets like <a href="https://twitter.com/Laforesta1/status/692504515904409600">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is exhausting fighting this uphill battle EVERY DAY. I see women like <span class="citation">@courtneymilan</span> <span class="citation">@AlishaRai</span> <span class="citation">@suleikhasnyder</span> <span class="citation">@FarrahRochon</span> speak up</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Tweeter’s bio includes the phrase “I try to be as nice as people think I am.”).<br />
This nice tweeter draws the metaphor of fighting.<br />
(Also interesting is “uphill battle”: fear and anger are much better motivators than happiness; everyone always thinks that <em>the other</em> side is winning).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/MsAnnAguirre/status/692442931697950720">This</a> from Milan:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you write a post about diversity and people of color drag it for being candy-coated racism and you delete and say people made you cry maybe consider that if dozens and dozens of POC are dragging it, you SHOULD feel badly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s very little nuance/sophistication to a view like “any time a bunch of coloured people call a white person racist, it must be true”. (Credit where credit is due: the emphasis of “dozens and dozens” at least better than “any POC”).<br />
It’s not hard to see this falls into the realms of Identity Politics. (One might’ve expected phrases like “white tears”).<br />
– But, again, the righteousness and certainty that what they’re doing is for the greater good.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The above tweets are just a brief (&amp; clearly incomplete) scan of twitterspace. (And with my remarks, you see how I feel about them). Don’t be offended if your tweets were left out, or if your tweets were included. I suspect a glance at the profiles of usual suspects would lead to a better understanding of the context.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>That</em> drama.<br />
A prominent author calls out a prominent reviewer, based on one wild inferences from odd statements. A surrounding community of those interested in diversity in romance see the virtue of Milan’s statements, and the heresy in Dumas’. (At a glance, most of the replies I saw were more “thank you for saying this” than “isn’t this a little excessive?”. Maybe the smart people who dissent are keeping their heads down, and <a href="http://free.bridal-shower-themes.com/img/i/-/i-am-not-a-clever-man_1.jpg">I am not a clever man</a>).</p>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting part of all this is the righteous tone of “she deserves it” as to the harassment/bullying Dumas is receiving; that those doing the bullying aren’t the bad people here.<br />
I don’t think anyone is socially conscious of the need for diversity in romance novels, without also being concerned about things like <a href="http://www.themarysue.com/tag/harassment/">online harassment of women</a>.<br />
This dissonance isn’t so hard to understand, though. <a href="../../posts/argument/2016-01-31-on-anger-and-activists.html">It seems to be an activist thing.</a>. So cries of “that’s bullying” is met with “yes, I’m not being ‘nice’, this is important”; cries of “this is disproportionate; you’re killing a fly with a howitzer” aren’t met with sympathy, either. (Aside from the note in aforementioned link, I suppose it’s that there’d be no need to be “angry” if things improved without the anger).<br />
– It’s also not hard to sympathise with. – If anyone knows a cure for righteous anger, I’d love to hear it, as quickly as your fingers allow.</p>
<p>My concern isn’t so much “Milan &amp; community are bullying a ‘bad’ person for the greater good.”:<br />
While that’s fun in itself to discuss, I think the greater concern is <em>why</em> the target was lambasted. The hate seems to miss the general message (“hey, diversity in romance isn’t as good as it could be; here are some good, diverse romances”) and instead focus on the sins of (inferences from!) specific sentences!<br />
– Whatsmore, while the repeated drumline for diversity in romance is “everyone deserves to get their HEA”, it doesn’t seem all that inclusive to bully-out of your in-group someone who transgresses by a sentence or two?<br />
Surely this is arbitrary condemnation? I tend to think the angry reviewers who write “Well, the book was nice, except for this one sentence about female sexuality…” are immature. This is like that, times 100. – Moreover, is it more .. beneficial to the ’cause of diversity in romance to attack a prominent figure promoting diversity?<br />
(Sorry, activists, but <a href="https://www-ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/Breakthrough/book/pdfs/axelrod.pdf">cooperation wins out over division</a>).</p>
<p>– If one wants hints for a more “collaborative” diversity effort: aside from the reminder that reading is good, and that reading has the amazing ability to get into someone else’s head.. how can one be against it? If people are writing books you don’t like, it’s no skin off your nose, y’know.</p>
<p>Personally, I’m not particularly persuaded by rumours/hearsay of “Dumas is a bad person”, if encounters <a href="https://twitter.com/suleikhasnyder/status/663197701715206144">like this</a>, wherein Dumas is criticised for using the phrase “namaste” while being white, are the crimes. – I’ve not seen all of twittersphere, though.</p>
<p>Some of the above tweets make use of terminology like “ally”. Unfortunately, it seems in these domains of the socially-conscious, similar <a href="http://uberfeminist.blogspot.co.uk/2015/10/friendly-fire-demise-of-social-justice.html">incidents of friendly-fire</a> aren’t unheard of.</p>
<p>If one is brave, one could also draw comparison between this divide in romancelandia, and the recent controversies in other entertainment media, wherein each side yells at the other “we care more about diversity / LGBTQ+ than they do”. Strange times. (I think it’d cause more upset to discuss than not; I’m not so brave, then).</p>
<hr />
<p>I do tend to think Dumas isn’t guilty of anything.<br />
But if I can further make explicit some of the political beliefs at play here: Even if Dumas <em>weren’t</em> in favour of diversity, so what? There seems to be this nice thought that what’s “fair” and “equal” should win. (And anger will get us there).</p>
<p>It seems to be a moral imperative to this crowd that Dumas, as a prominent reviewer, do everything in her power for the cause. Why? In a free market, the disruptor’s need neither permission nor help from those at the top in order to make money doing things in an improved way.<br />
Similarly, it’s understood (grudgingly) that what books are “popular” aren’t necessarily the same as what books “good quality”. Sometimes things aren’t fair.<br />
(Of course, I guess such thinking also sees there’s no need to be “fair” about bullying anyone, either, so).</p>
<hr />
<p>One doesn’t tend to think of romancelandia as discordant.<br />
You’d also think that a genre set on characters having Happily Ever Afters wouldn’t have a problem with authors getting along with each other. – I guess if the present drama were in a RN, you’d probably rate it 2-stars, for how flat the characters seem to be, and how they don’t talk respectively to one another.</p>
