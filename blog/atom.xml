    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, Tweag’s blog featured a post on <a href="https://www.tweag.io/blog/2022-08-18-nixos-specialisations/">NixOS
specialisations</a>.</p>
<p>It allows for having an additional boot entry in grub which
loads a slightly different configuration. – This makes it very convenient
to try slightly different NixOS configurations.</p>
<p>As the blogpost above shows, this can be used for different desktop environments.</p>
<p>I ran into some problems with conflicting attributes, and wasn’t previously
aware of how to set the priority. (e.g. as discussed in this <a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/what-does-mkdefault-do-exactly/9028">discourse
post</a>).</p>
<p>e.g. I’d wanted to try out the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pantheon">Pantheon</a> desktop environment, which comes out of <a href="https://elementary.io/">Elementary OS</a> and looks very nice. – But, if you try to enable both <code>services.xserver.desktopManager.gnome</code> and <code>services.xserver.desktopManager.pantheon</code>, you get an error like:</p>
<pre><code>error: The option `environment.sessionVariables.NIX_GSETTINGS_OVERRIDES_DIR&#39; has conflicting definition values:</code></pre>
<p>Not knowing about overriding attribute priorities, my first attempt at solving this problem was using <code>specialisations</code> to separate the conflicting config options: <a href="https://github.com/rgoulter/nix-user-repository/blob/8df3abaea46b8fbd5d212e64c209d5ef0602955c/modules/desktops.nix">8df3…/modules/desktops.nix</a>.</p>
<p>Knowing the above about overriding attribute priorites, it makes sense that it’s possible to use Gnome in the ‘parent’ config, and to disable Gnome in the specialisations, with:</p>
<pre><code>services.xserver.desktopManager.gnome.enable = lib.mkDefault true;</code></pre>
<p>e.g. <a href="https://github.com/rgoulter/nix-user-repository/blob/c3f0df686ea024f3fae8da13dae6e10a02e920cd/modules/desktops.nix">c3f0…./modules/desktops.nix</a>.</p>
<pre class="nix"><code>{ config, lib, pkgs, ... }:

{
  services = {
    xserver = {
      desktopManager.gnome.enable = lib.mkDefault true;
      displayManager.gdm.enable = lib.mkDefault true;

      enable = true;

      layout = &quot;us&quot;;
    };
  };

  specialisation = {
    gnome.configuration = {
      services.xserver = {
        desktopManager.gnome.enable = true;
        displayManager.gdm.enable = true;
      };
      system.nixos.tags = [ &quot;gnome&quot; ];
    };
    pantheon.configuration = {
      services.xserver = {
        # Pantheon conflicts with gnome
        desktopManager = {
          gnome.enable = false;
          pantheon.enable = true;
        };
        # Pantheon requires lightdm
        displayManager = {
          gdm.enable = false;
          lightdm.enable = true;
        };
      };
      system.nixos.tags = [ &quot;pantheon&quot; ];
    };
    xfce.configuration = {
      networking.networkmanager.enable = true;
      services.xserver = {
        desktopManager = {
          gnome.enable = false;
          xfce.enable = true;
        };
        displayManager = {
          gdm.enable = false;
        };
      };
      system.nixos.tags = [ &quot;gnome&quot; ];
    };
  };

    <title>Travel Setup Using a Fancy Keyboard with a Laptop</title>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the downsides to using a fancy keyboard is that it’s difficult to use
when out and about with a laptop.</p>
<p>This is arguably mitigated by that laptops themselves have a keyboard.</p>
<p>I like my small, fancy keyboard much more than the laptop keyboard, though.
(My thumbs get access to 2-3 keys each on my fancy keyboard, etc.).</p>
<p>Here’s the travel setup I’ve used:</p>
<p>The first thing which helps is getting a bit of acrylic cut to shape, with some
bumpons to lift it above the keys:</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rgoulter/rgoulter.github.com/master/images/keyboards/travel-setup/keyboard_travel_mba.JPG" /></p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rgoulter/rgoulter.github.com/master/images/keyboards/travel-setup/keyboard_travel_mba_plate.JPG" /></p>
<p>In terms of cables:</p>
<p>I was able to have a working setup with an ordinary USB-C cable. Since the
cable needs some clearance, the keyboard couldn’t quite be close to the screen.
Thanks to how HUGE the Macbook trackpads are, I could get by without needing an
extra mouse.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rgoulter/rgoulter.github.com/master/images/keyboards/travel-setup/keyboard_travel_mba_plate_usbc.JPG" /></p>
<p>What I haven’t yet tried while traveling, but I expect to work much better, is
to use a USB-C cable with a right-angle connector:</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rgoulter/rgoulter.github.com/master/images/keyboards/travel-setup/keyboard_travel_mba_plate_rightangle.JPG" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately, use of right-angled connectors like this depends a bit on the
keyboard. In the following pictures, both have a magnetic connector inserted.
The right-angled USB-C cables I’ve tried cannot connect to the BM40, since the
case is too thick.</p>

    <title>A Visual Explanation of GPG Subkeys</title>

    <updated>2022-06-10T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As with anyone who’s been using git for long enough, I’m familiar enough with
SSH keys (Even to the point where I don’t really need to follow <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent">the GitHub docs
for generating a new
key</a>.</p>
<p>My developer journey hasn’t led me to build the same intuition for GPG keys.</p>
<p>So, when I see fancy wiki pages and guids, such as <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Subkeys">Debian wiki’s page on
subkeys</a>, <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/OfflineMasterKey">on offline master
keys</a>, or <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/GnuPG/AirgappedMasterKey">on an airgapped master
key</a>, it sounds really fancy;
but I’m left curious to get an intuition for what’s going on.</p>
<p>I hope to use this blogpost illustrate enough of the details to build an
intuition.</p>
<h3 id="public-key-cryptography">Public Key Cryptography</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">Wikipedia page on Public Key cryptography</a>
has some nice diagrams.</p>
<p>This itself should still be relatively straightforward, comparing with how SSH
keys get used with git forges like GitHub, and with SSHing into servers:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rgoulter/rgoulter.github.com/master/images/gpg/key_generation.png"  /></p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><p>You have a key pair with a private key and public key,</p></li>
<li><p>you keep the private key <em>private</em>,</p></li>
<li><p>you share the public key with the servers you want to access to.</p>
<ul>
<li>Having the private key gives access.
And this is ‘secure’ because only the user with the private key
which matches the public keys will be granted access.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>So it makes sense: Encrypting;</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rgoulter/rgoulter.github.com/master/images/gpg/encrypt_document.png"  />
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rgoulter/rgoulter.github.com/master/images/gpg/decrypt_document.png"  /></p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><p>You encrypt something for someone else using their public key.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Everyone has their public key, so everyone can send them something.</p></li>
<li><p>Only they have their private key, so only they can read the message.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Or signing:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rgoulter/rgoulter.github.com/master/images/gpg/sign_document.png"  />
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rgoulter/rgoulter.github.com/master/images/gpg/verify_signature.png"  /></p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><p>You sign something with your private key.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You’re the only person who has your private key, so only you can sign something.</p></li>
<li><p>Everyone has your public key, so everyone else can verify you signed it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-rote-gpg-commands">The Rote GPG Commands</h3>
<p>So far, we can just label everything above with “GPG” and it still makes sense:</p>
<p>e.g. Key generation could be done by invoking a command like:</p>
<pre><code>gpg --quick-generate-key &quot;Richard Goulter (NixOS Desktop) &lt;richard.goulter@rgoulter.com&gt;&quot;</code></pre>
<p>e.g. exporting a key, to copy the public part to GitHub or whatever could be done by invoking a command like:</p>
<pre><code>gpg --export --armor &quot;Richard Goulter (NixOS Desktop)&quot;</code></pre>
<p>e.g. encrypting/decrypting a message could be done by invoking a command like:</p>
<pre><code>gpg --encrypt --recipient &quot;My Colleague&quot; document.txt</code></pre>
<p>and the recipient could decrypt it with:</p>
<pre><code>gpg --decrypt document.txt.gpg</code></pre>
<p>e.g. signing could be done by invoking a command like:</p>
<pre><code>gpg --clearsign file.txt</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>gpg --detach-sign file.txt</code></pre>
<p>and the signature could be verified with a command like:</p>
<pre><code>gpg --verify file.txt.asc</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>gpg --verify file.txt.sig</code></pre>
<h3 id="what-starts-to-confuse-me-subkeys">What Starts to Confuse Me: Subkeys</h3>
<p>Okay, but having created a key, then list the keys:</p>
<pre><code>gpg --list-keys</code></pre>
<p>outputs something like:</p>
<pre>
pub   rsa4096 2020-10-05 [SC] [expires: 2022-08-01]
      D9463A85F093811B887DE4B03229F4BB09CC8A22

</pre>
<p>and secret keys:</p>
<pre><code>gpg --list-secret-keys</code></pre>
<p>outputs something like:</p>
<pre>
sec   rsa4096 2020-10-05 [SC] [expires: 2022-08-01]

</pre>
<p>I can see the only difference is <code>pub</code>, <code>sub</code>, vs <code>sec</code> and <code>ssb</code>. What?</p>
<p>What’s <code>[SC]</code>, <code>[E]</code>?</p>
<p>And if you enable some recommended options in <code>~/.gnupg/gpg.conf</code>:</p>
<pre><code>keyid-format LONG

<p>re-running:</p>
<pre><code>gpg --list-keys</code></pre>
<p>outputs:</p>

<p>I feel like this one I’m allowed to be confused by.</p>
<p>Long Id?</p>
<p>Fingerprint??</p>
<p>Keygrip???</p>
<h3 id="a-key-consisting-of-multiple-keys">A Key Consisting of Multiple Keys</h3>
<p>Uh. Hopefully it’s not too late in this blogpost to mention it.<br />
But “key” gets used in multiple ways e.g. “running <code>gpg --quick-generate-key</code>
generates a GPG ‘key’”, and in “a GPG ‘key’ consists of at least one key pair”.</p>
<p>Generally, context is often enough to disambiguate these. But given that GPG is
confusing enough as it is, it’s worth mentioning the ambiguity.</p>
<p>Taking a look at the terminology GPG’s manual uses:
<a href="https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html#CONCEPTS" class="uri">https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html#CONCEPTS</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>GnuPG uses a somewhat more sophisticated scheme in which a user has a primary
keypair and then zero or more additional subordinate keypairs. The primary and
subordinate keypairs are bundled to facilitate key management and the bundle
can often be considered simply as one keypair.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This excerpt refers to the keys being ‘bundled’, and that the bundle can often
be considered as a keypair.</p>
<p>The GnuPG FAQ has an answer which better describes the ambiguity.
<a href="https://www.gnupg.org/faq/gnupg-faq.html#define_key" class="uri">https://www.gnupg.org/faq/gnupg-faq.html#define_key</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The word ‘key’ is unfortunately ambiguous. It can either refer to the
mathematical structures that allow encryption, decryption, signing and
verification to occur, or to the rather large blobs of data that contain those
mathematical structures as well as information about the person associated
with it, additional subkeys, and so forth.</p>
<p>With respect to the large blobs of data, it is preferable to call them
‘certificates’, so that the word ‘key’ may be unambiguously recognized as
meaning just the mathematical structures. Unfortunately, this is a custom that
seems to be honored mostly in the breach.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this blogpost, I’ll try to use the word “key” in scare quotes to indicate
“bundle of key pairs”.</p>
<h3 id="other-gpg-featurescomplications">Other GPG Features/Complications</h3>
<p>So while I feel like the idea of “a key pair, with a private part and a public
part” is understandable, there are other features of GPG “keys” which make
things more complicated:</p>
<p>GPG “keys” can be set with an expiry date.<br />
(This is useful as a way of indicating you’ve still got access to the private
key).</p>
<p>GPG “keys” can have multiple “User IDs” (Name + email). Photos can be included
in the GPG “key”.</p>
<p>GPG “keys” can be signed. Or more specifically: the keys and UIDs can be signed.<br />
– I don’t find this intuitive. Sure, Bruce Wayne and Batman are different
identities, but I don’t see why they’d want to use the same key.</p>
<p>GPG “keys” can be revoked. That is, an indication that other subkeys or UIDs or signatures
should not be trusted.<br />
– I didn’t find this intuitive.</p>
<p>GPG “keys” can have some level of trust.<br />
– This also seems unintuitive to me.</p>
<h3 id="why-subkeys-are-subkeys">Why Subkeys are Subkeys</h3>
<p>I found <a href="https://serverfault.com/questions/397973/gpg-why-am-i-encrypting-with-subkey-instead-of-primary-key">this StackOverflow answer about why different keys are used for
encryption vs signing</a>
illuminating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you look into the details of the math of public-key encryption, you will
discover that signing and decrypting are actually identical operations. Thus
in a naïve implementation it is possible to trick somebody into decrypting a
message by asking them to sign it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>i.e. it would be bad a idea to use the same (sub)key for both signing and
encryption. So, GPG uses a separate subkey for at least encryption.</p>
<p>This answer also explains what the <code>[SC]</code> and <code>[E]</code> refer to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>E = encrypt/decrypt (decrypt a message you received encrypted for you to read)<br />
S = sign (sign data. For example a file or to send signed e-mail)<br />
C = certify (sign another key, establishing a trust-relation)<br />
A = authentication (log in to SSH with a PGP key; this is relatively new usage)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">Wikipedia page about RSA</a>
gives an example of using RSA keys, which is useful for understanding “signing
and decrypting are identical operations”.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html#AEN267">The GPG User Guide (Section “Key Management”, subsection “Key
integrity”)</a> sort of does
explain the “master” and “subordinate” part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using digital signatures is a solution to this problem. When data is signed by
a private key, the corresponding public key is bound to the signed data. In
other words, only the corresponding public key can be used to verify the
signature and ensure that the data has not been modified. A public key can be
protected from tampering by using its corresponding private master key to sign
the public key components and user IDs, thus binding the components to the
public master key. Signing public key components with the corresponding
private master signing key is called self-signing, and a public key that has
self-signed user IDs bound to it is called a certificate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ‘self-signing’ of sub-keys by the master key is a detail which wasn’t clear to me.</p>
<p>“Subordinate” is a surprising word here.<br />
Even the <em>absolutely excellent</em> post <a href="https://davesteele.github.io/gpg/2014/09/20/anatomy-of-a-gpg-key/">“anatomy of a gpg
key”</a> expands
“subkey” to “sub-component of another key”, not “subordinate key”.</p>
<p>I further feel vindication in that the website <a href="https://gpg.wtf/" class="uri">https://gpg.wtf/</a> also discusses
‘what a subkey is’ in its “things that are confusing about gpg”.</p>
<p>The “master key signs the subkeys” can be seen by running a command like:</p>
<pre><code>gpg --check-signatures 0x3229F4BB09CC8A22</code></pre>
<p>which outputs something like:</p>
<style>
span.key0 {
  color: #2072B8;
}
span.key1 {
  color: #7FBA42;
}
</style>

gpg: 2 good signatures
</pre>
<p>i.e. The GPG “key” has:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the public master key,</p></li>
<li><p>a UID which is signed with the <code>[SC]</code> key,</p></li>
<li><p>a subordiate key, which is intended for <code>[E]</code> usage, as signed with the <code>[SC]</code> key.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="illustrating-the-rote-gpg-operations">Illustrating the Rote GPG Operations</h3>
<p>Going back over the rote commands again, now with a diagrams to illustrate
subkeys at work:</p>
<p>e.g. key generation:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rgoulter/rgoulter.github.com/master/images/gpg/sign_document.png"  /></p>
</div>
<p>could be done by invoking a command like:</p>
<pre><code>gpg --quick-generate-key &quot;Richard Goulter (NixOS Desktop) &lt;richard.goulter@rgoulter.com&gt;&quot;</code></pre>
<p>e.g. exporting a key, to copy the public part to GitHub or whatever:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rgoulter/rgoulter.github.com/master/images/gpg/gpg_export_key.png"  /></p>
</div>
<p>could be done by invoking a command like:</p>
<pre><code>gpg --export --armor &quot;Richard Goulter (NixOS Desktop)&quot;</code></pre>
<p>e.g. encrypting/decrypting a message:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rgoulter/rgoulter.github.com/master/images/gpg/gpg_encrypt_document.png"  />
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rgoulter/rgoulter.github.com/master/images/gpg/gpg_decrypt_document.png"  /></p>
</div>
<p>could be done by invoking a command like:</p>
<pre><code>gpg --encrypt --recipient &quot;My Colleague&quot; document.txt</code></pre>
<p>and the recipient could decrypt it with:</p>
<pre><code>gpg --decrypt document.txt.gpg</code></pre>
<p>e.g. signing:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rgoulter/rgoulter.github.com/master/images/gpg/gpg_sign_document.png"  />
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rgoulter/rgoulter.github.com/master/images/gpg/gpg_verify_signature.png"  /></p>
</div>
<p>could be done by invoking a command like:</p>
<pre><code>gpg --clearsign file.txt</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>gpg --detach-sign file.txt</code></pre>
<p>and the signature could be verified with a command like:</p>
<pre><code>gpg --verify file.txt.asc</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>gpg --verify file.txt.sig</code></pre>
<h3 id="gpg-for-ssh">GPG for SSH</h3>
<p>Again, coming from the mindset of “SSH keys for pushing to <code>git</code> repositories,
<code>gpg</code> for signing stuff”, hearing “GPG ‘keys’ can be used for SSH too” sounds
like wizardry.</p>
<p>This is also where “keygrip” comes into use. As <a href="https://blog.djoproject.net/2020/05/03/main-differences-between-a-gnupg-fingerprint-a-ssh-fingerprint-and-a-keygrip/">this blogpost discussing GPG
fingerprint vs SSH key fingerprint vs GPG
keygrip</a>
explains, the keygrip is a way of identifying the key regardless of
protocol/usage.</p>
<p>Now that I have a better understanding of subkeys,
it seems the main points for “using GPG for SSH” involves two things to understand:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Using a suitably configured <code>gpg-agent</code> instead of <code>ssh-agent</code>, by pointing
the <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> and <code>SSH_AGENT_PID</code> to GPG.</p></li>
<li><p>Having a subkey with <code>[A]</code> capability.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="visualisation-of-the-offline-master-key-setup">Visualisation of the Offline Master Key Setup</h3>
<p>With the above in mind, a summary of the result of these tutorials for setting
up master keys could be visualised as follows:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rgoulter/rgoulter.github.com/master/images/gpg/gpg_offline_master_key.png"  /></p>
</div>
<p>Which seems less complex than all the confusion I had over it made it out to be.</p>
<p>As the Debian wiki article pages discuss, because the private master key is used
to self-sign the subkeys in the GPG “key”, it can then be used to revoke the
other subkeys.</p>
<h3 id="yubikey-as-a-gpg-smart-card">Yubikey as a GPG Smart Card</h3>
<p>Yubikeys can then allow a nicer User Experience for using
GPG keys. e.g. the Yubikey supports 3 slots for private keys: for signing, encryption, or authentication.</p>

    <title>EPA in Emacs is a Neat UX on top of GPG</title>

    <updated>2022-06-07T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>GPG is notorious for having an archane interface
which is easy to misuse.</p>
<p>As a developer, the most I’ve used it for has been to
sign git commits.</p>
<p>Emacs supports a workflow which uses GPG to automatically
decrypt the file when reading it, and automatically
encrypt the file when saving it.</p>
<p>With the Doom Emacs distribution of Emacs,
if the user’s <code>config.el</code> sets <code>user-full-name</code> or <code>user-mail-address</code>,
and the GnuPG keyring on the computer has a PGP key pair with this
as a user ID, then this works seamlessly. (Well, subject to things
like pinentry and GPG agents and all).</p>
<p>Even that sounds complicated; but you probably will have those things set
if you’re using Doom Emacs; and probably do have GPG keys with your email/name
if you’ve used GPG for anything.</p>
<p>Since the acronyms are confusing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>PGP = Pretty Good Privacy. OpenPGP is an open standard for signing/encrypting things.</p></li>
<li><p>GPG = GnuPG = Gnu Privacy Guard. Implements OpenPGP.</p></li>
<li><p>EPG = EasyPG. An Emacs library for GnuPG.</p></li>
<li><p>EPA = EasyPG Assistant. The Emacs user interface to GnuPG that’s part of the EPG package.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Some notes:</p>
<p>Doom Emacs achieves this in its <code>modules/config/default/config.el</code>:</p>
<pre class="elisp"><code>(after! epa
  ;; With GPG 2.1+, this forces gpg-agent to use the Emacs minibuffer to prompt
  ;; for the key passphrase.
  (set &#39;epg-pinentry-mode &#39;loopback)
  ;; Default to the first enabled and non-expired key in your keyring.
  (setq-default
   epa-file-encrypt-to
   (or (default-value &#39;epa-file-encrypt-to)
       (unless (string-empty-p user-full-name)
         (when-let (context (ignore-errors (epg-make-context)))
           (cl-loop for key in (epg-list-keys context user-full-name &#39;public)
                    for subkey = (car (epg-key-sub-key-list key))
                    if (not (memq &#39;disabled (epg-sub-key-capability subkey)))
                    if (&lt; (or (epg-sub-key-expiration-time subkey) 0)
                          (time-to-seconds))
                    collect (epg-sub-key-fingerprint subkey))))
       user-mail-address))
   ;; And suppress prompts if epa-file-encrypt-to has a default value (without
   ;; overwriting file-local values).
  (defadvice! +default--dont-prompt-for-keys-a (&amp;rest _)
    :before #&#39;epa-file-write-region
    (unless (local-variable-p &#39;epa-file-encrypt-to)
      (setq-local epa-file-encrypt-to (default-value &#39;epa-file-encrypt-to)))))</code></pre>
<p>Since it wasn’t obvious to me: the <code>epa-file-encrypt-to</code> is used to determine
which PGP keys in the keyring to encrypt the file to.<br />
It’s sortof similar to the <code>--recipient</code> flag when using <code>gpg --encrypt</code>.
Some additional functionality EPA adds is that if there are multiple public
keys which match, EPA will encrypt the file for all of these; whereas <code>gpg --encrypt</code>
will only encrypt for the most recent encryption key which matches.</p>
<p>When opening an encrypted file,
<code>epa-file-encrypt-to</code> will be filled with the keys which were used to encrypt
the file. You can change the value of this variable to change which keys
are used to encrypt the file.</p>
<p>Also, since it wasn’t obvious to me: a file encrypted with <code>gpg</code> for multiple
keys is like a concatenation of the file encrypted for each key. So a file
can obviously be encrypted for multiple keys; and that encrypted file can
be decrypted with any of the keys it was encrypted with.</p>
<p>In Emacs, you can visit the <code>info</code> node for EPA’s encrypting/decrypting by
executing the elisp:</p>
<pre class="elisp"><code>(info &quot;(epa) Encrypting/decrypting gpg files&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>(assuming <code>epa.info</code> has been installed to the right place).</p>
<p>Or, going to the “EasyPG Assistant” manual, “Commands”, “Encrypting/decrypting gpg files” menu items.</p>
<p>Or, in the online manual: <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/epa/Encrypting_002fdecrypting-gpg-files.html" class="uri">https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/epa/Encrypting_002fdecrypting-gpg-files.html</a>.</p>]]></summary>

    <title>Tool Recommendation: Helix Editor</title>
    <link href="http://www.rgoulter.com/blog//posts/programming/2022-05-19-tool-recommendation-helix-editor.html" />

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://helix-editor.com/">Helix editor</a> is a fancy new text editor which
looks to be a compelling competitor to vim for modern developer environments.</p>
<p>Currently, my preferred editing environment is Emacs, making use of the Doom
Emacs distribution.</p>
<p>Before that, I was using vim (and its cousin, neovim). And I still use
neovim for editing files from the command line.</p>
<p>But, I’d heard of <a href="http://kakoune.org/">kakoune</a>. Kakoune takes the “verb +
text object” text navigation and manipulation of Vim, and flips it into a more
user friendly direction: Kakoune opts for “text object + verb”.</p>
<p>This seems like it would soften the rough edges of the finer parts of vim. It’s
often easier to make use of vim’s visual mode, and then copy/delete/replace that
selection.</p>
<p>So. The <a href="https://helix-editor.com/">Helix editor</a>, another text editor, is
interesting for a few reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It takes the same user-friendly “text object + verb” approach that kakoune
used. (This also allows for powerful multi-cursor text manipulation).</p></li>
<li><p>It leverages <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">language server protocol
(LSP)</a>, which enables
editor integration with language compilers, allowing for code completion or
quickly bringing up documentation.</p></li>
<li><p>It leverages <a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/">tree sitter</a>. This
allows different editors to share parsers for different languages, for syntax
highlighting, or perhaps navigation of text objects.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>So. It’s got a few fancy features, each are worth being excited about.</p>
<p>So I’ve given it a try.</p>
<p>Overall, as a vim user, trying out Helix has the following loop:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Try and use Helix as if it’s vim (but swapping text object and action).</p></li>
<li><p>Be surprised when something doesn’t work, because Helix isn’t vim,
so look up the equivalent action, and remember to use the Helix
keybinding.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I’d say the ‘trouble’ here is that with Vim, there’s a long tail of keybindings
which you’ll use infrequently.</p>
<p>e.g. it took me a while to notice that Helix doesn’t open directories in
a buffer. (Whereas, vim has netrw, and Emacs has dired).</p>
<p>Overall, Helix’s keybindings seem consistent and well thought out.</p>
<p>e.g. my current “rosetta stone” is:</p>

<col style="width: 11%" />

    <title>Use of Anki for Programming</title>
    <link href="http://www.rgoulter.com/blog//posts/programming/2022-05-01-use-of-anki-for-programming.html" />
    <id>http://www.rgoulter.com/blog//posts/programming/2022-05-01-use-of-anki-for-programming.html</id>

    <updated>2022-05-01T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Anki is software which helps you to review flash cards.
What’s notable about it is it uses the idea of Spaced Repitition;
by getting you to recall something at approximately the time you
would otherwise have forgotten it, you’re better able to recall
some fact at increasingly long intervals.</p>
<p>This is useful for foreign language learning (or health science)
where you’ll want to recall terms, sometimes with low frequency.</p>
<p>One serious article I’ve seen about using Anki for non-language stuff
was this:
<a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html" class="uri">http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html</a></p>
<p>One quick take-away I recall is just the emphasis that Anki isn’t
a completely magical to help you remember everything.</p>
<p>For things you use frequently anyway, Anki won’t be of much help.
And for things you wish to recall in infrequent contexts,
Anki is going to require much more effort than it’s worth. (As in,
it’s harder to remember because you won’t have motivation to use it).</p>
<p>For programming, I’ve only used Anki slightly.</p>
<p>To give a somewhat specific example of how I’ve used it:
e.g. I noticed I wanted to be able to recall the different <code>ServiceType</code>s
of a Kubernetes <code>Service</code>. e.g. per https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types<br />
I think once you understand the concept, recalling the facts of it
is easier.<br />
Short of that, the easiest flashcard to make is with a brute-force
approach which enumerates the types. (Which is not terrible in this case,
since there are four types).<br />
I’d say it would be better to then later create more flash cards about the
topic. e.g. in this case, flashcards about what the default service type is,
and flashcards in the form “service type which exposes service on a port on
each node” or “service type which uses cloud provider’s load balancer”, etc.</p>
<p>Another example I have been trying recently has been keybindings.
e.g. I want to be able to use the fancy Helix editor, or to get
more out of Doom Emacs.<br />
Keybindings which work well in you workflow are easy to remember.<br />
But.. I think it’s always easier to continue doing something in an
known-and-adequate-but-bad way rather than a nice-but-unknown way.<br />
I think writing up flashcards for anki helps to build the mental
model for what the mnemonics for the keybindings are. And I think
“I’d like to use this functionality, but can’t recall the keybinding”
is close to that margin of “frequent enough to want to recall it,
infrequent enough such that you’re not using it all the time”.</p>
<p>In the worst case, I think Anki flashcards are a useful intermediate artifact
to aim for when studying.</p>]]></summary>

    <title>Prime Video's Invincible is Wonderful</title>

    <updated>2022-05-01T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon Prime Video’s “Invincible” is probably most well known
for <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/think-mark/">the meme image</a>.</p>
<p>I saw it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1Mlm2LLcs0">recommended by the YouTube channel “Critical
Drinker”</a>.</p>
<p>So I watched the show, it’s pretty good!</p>
<p>In the same way that “Rick and Morty”’s Rick and Morty are kinda bastardised
versions of “Back to the Future”’s Doc and Marty,
“Invincible” is kindof a bastardised homage to superhero media the same way
“The Incredibles” is.</p>
<p>It’s both a bit dark, at times emphasising cosmic-horror themes that underlie
superhero shows, as well as poking fun of superhero motifs.</p>
<p>I find the show suspenseful and subversive.</p>
<p>“Subversive” seems almost a joke term with regards to how it was used to
describe Star Wars’ “The Last Jedi”. TLJ pretty much shits on the legacy that
came before it.. I think to the point where it’s so different from the material
it’s ‘subverting’, that it’s not interesting to watch.</p>
<p>A better example of “subversive”, I think, was in the side quests of the game
“The Witcher 3”. In the Witcher 3, you play a fantasy wizard-warrior. The game
follows your expectations about 90% of the time. As in, 90% of the time,
playing a heroic figure who rescues the people from monsters works out well,
but 10% of the time you’ll be punished for being naive or foolish or whatever.</p>
<p>I think with “Invincible”, it’s similar.<br />
The show knows what you’re set to expect, and will deliver on that most of the
time; but will vary from that <em>just</em> enough to keep you on your toes.<br />
So you end up with 3 or 4 plots going throughout the story where you’re not sure
whether you can trust the characters or not.</p>
<p>I think the premise of the show is more interesting than the characters or plot
of the show, though. – I found “Rick and Morty” less interesting as the show
seemed to try to develop its characters.. but the characters are only really
interesting as archetypes in the weird situations.<br />
Invincible’s characters are largely not-Superman, not-the-Justice-League, etc.
and I enjoyed them as they played a part in this half-ironic, mature
interpretation of superhero stories.</p>
<p>The show’s worst part is definitely the main character’s love interest.<br />
The love interest is the kind of person who reads Ta Nehisi Coates.. the
character certainly doesn’t seem to get the same edgy interpretation treatment
the rest of the show tells its story from. (Unless the love interest’s character
is supposed to subvert our expectations that the superhero’s love interest be
a likeable character. Which, maybe is the intent).<br />
– I was fairly annoyed by one plot point: love interest and the main character
are visiting a college campus when a villain terrorises the square. The main
character runs off to Clarke-Kent-into-Superman, then fights and stops the
villain. Afterwards, the love interest chastises the main character for running
away and not helping people(?!). – We then find out she had already
figured out that her boyfriend was the superhero. – It comes across as
holier-than-thou, smarter-than-thou, author’s-daughter-stand-in character.</p>
<p>So. I dunno if the story’s going to be able to keep up the momentum.
But, I think the edgy, humorous interpretation of popular culture is interesting.
I think it’d be interesting to see Star Wars or whatever in a similar manner.</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I liked Bridgerton Season 2 more than Season 1.</p>
<p>It’s good.<br />
The sweet parts are properly sweet.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>It’s long.</p>
<p>It’s loooooooooooooooooong.</p>
<p>I was ambivalent about Season 1. The season was filled half with a sweet
romantic story, and half with a bitter cynical dramatic story.<br />
I didn’t like the mix.</p>
<p>Season 2 is mostly devoit of the bitter cynical drama stuff that polluted
Season 1.<br />
But.<br />
It seemed to drag on a bit.</p>
<p>I liked the first half of the season, which proceeds at a steady pace through
the will-they/will-they relationship between the Hero and Heroine. The two have
witty banter. As characters, they both feel bound by duty to do their best to
help their family.<br />
By halfway, the story seems to reach its climax. (The skeleton of it being that
the Hero was going to marry the most popular girl of the year, the Heroine’s
sister. The wedding was planned to be big/fancy, but the Hero ruins the
wedding by giving the Heroine hungry eyes).<br />
Which leaves half the season left to meander around for the Hero to admit his
love for the Herione. And not much plot which rises to the level of “big fancy
wedding” to do it with. (The two families are both snubbed in scandal because
of it, but by the end their popular reputation is restored because they were
nice to the Queen).</p>
<p>Listening to the instrumental arrangements of pop songs that play in the
season is very fun, and brings the best parts of the season to mind!</p>
<p>I think that explains why Season 1 was filled with the bitter cynical dramatic
crap.<br />
It pads out the meat of the romance to help with pacing.<br />
(That they chose bitter crap to pad it with is just a weird decision).</p>
<p>For Season 2, the writers apparently decided to chill out on the bitterness.<br />
The padding is still dramatic fluff.<br />
I don’t think the show would be worth watching if it were just this padding.<br />
It’s not terrible, but it’s also not fun or particularly engaging.<br />
e.g. one arc has B. Bridgerton (not the main character in this season) hope to
attend an art school, get into the art school, later discover that he got into
the school because his rich family donated money to the school, so he quits the
art school.<br />
Not terrible.<br />
But. idk. I just don’t find it compelling.</p>
<p>(And the fun instrumental pop arrangements don’t bring to mind any of this
fluff, either!).</p>
<p>Overall, I’m glad Season 2 has got less of the bitter crap that Season 1 had.
I’m happy that the sweet romantic parts were sweet.</p>]]></summary>
